# ok

This is `ok`. Or at least, it will be.   
`ok`, right now, is a fork of `pytest`. 

It might grow, or shrink, to be something else.

## This is an "alpha" project, at best.

- Use at your own risk.
- Features are being removed, so no gaurantees.
- You should probably use pytest, until the dust settles.

## Removed so far

- unittest support (with version 0.832.2)
