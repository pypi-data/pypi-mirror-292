# Welcome to the Chainalysis Data Solutions Python SDK
A modern python wrapper for the Chainalysis Data Solutions API Suite.

## Documentation
See the latest documentation on all available classes and methods at our wiki page [here](https://github.com/TransposeData/chainalysis-data-solutions-python-sdk/wiki).

## Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command in bash.

```bash
pip install chainalysis
```

## Getting Started
Get an API Key at our [website](https://data.chainalysis.com/) by registering an account and
navigating to settings in the data solutions product section.


Begin using the SDK with the code below as a sample. The following code snippet details how to import and instantiate the Data Solutions Client to then be used to execute two kinds of queries: Analytical and Transactional.

Analytical queries are queries targeting the data you can view under the 'Explore Data' tab in Data Solutions. Transactional queries are queries targeting data you can find at [docs.transpose.io](docs.transpose.io).

```python
    # Import the module
    from chainalysis.data_solutions import DataSolutionsClient

    # Instantiate with an API Key
    ds = DataSolutionsClient({API_KEY})

    # Construct a transactional query
    query = """
        SELECT * from {{chain}}.blocks LIMIT 1
    """

    # Execute the query
    query_results = ds.sql.transactional(
        query=query,
        parameters={
            "chain": "ethereum",
        }
    )

    # OR construct an analytical query
    query = """
        SELECT * FROM cross_chain.clusters WHERE address = '0x00703a0ce5406501c44ca657497c0f785e83dde0' LIMIT 10;
    """

    # Execute the query
    query_results = ds.sql.analytical(
        query=query,
        parameters={
            "chain": "bitcoin",
        },
        polling_interval_sec=5, # How often the Databricks table should be pinged to see if data is available yet
    )

    # Print the results of the query as a json blob
    print(query_results.json())

    # Return the results of the query as a Pandas Dataframe
    dataframe = query_results.df()
```
