# Artificial Intelligence for Games and Simulations

In this course we use Python 3.11. Running `pip install aigs`
in a clean Python 3.11 virtual environment should install all dependencies.
We are assuming that you have a basic understanding of Python and programming.


## Labs

`labs/` contains exercises for the course, which you should do.
Being able to do the contents of `labs/` is a prerequisite
for being able making a successful final project.

I recommend cloning this repository, and making a folder `my/`
where you can put your own code (I will be updating this repository).

1. [Math](labs/lab_1.py)
2. Neural Networks ...
3. ...
