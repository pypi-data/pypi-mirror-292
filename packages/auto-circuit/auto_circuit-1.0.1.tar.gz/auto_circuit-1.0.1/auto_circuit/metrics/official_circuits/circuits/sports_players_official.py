    The full Sports Players circuit from input to output, as discovered by
    [Rajamanoharan et al. (2023)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3tqJ65kuTkBh8wrRH/).

    Read the source code comments for precise details on our interpretation of the
    circuit. The focus of the paper was on probing for sports features, so the exact
    set of edges that constitute the circuit is somewhat ambiguous.

    Args:
        model: A patchable TransformerLens Pythia 2.8B `HookedTransformer` model.
        token_positions: Whether to distinguish between token positions when returning
            the set of circuit edges. If `True`, we require that the `model` has
            `seq_len` not `None` (ie. separate edges for each token position) and that
            `word_idxs` is provided.
        word_idxs: A dictionary defining the index of specific named tokens in the
            circuit definition. For this circuit, the required tokens positions are:
            <ul>
                <li><code>first_name_tok</code></li>
                <li><code>final_name_tok</code></li>
                <li><code>end</code></li>
            </ul>
        seq_start_idx: Offset to add to all of the token positions in `word_idxs`.
            This is useful when using KV caching to skip the common prefix of the
            prompt.

    Returns:
        The set of edges in the circuit.
