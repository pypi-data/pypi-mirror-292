# OpenAPI Trimmer

⚡ Python / Bash CLI Tool to Trim OpenAPI Paths / Endpoints ⚡

OpenAPI Trimmer is a lightweight tool designed to trim down your OpenAPI files to include only the
endpoints and data transfer objects (DTOs) you care about. This helps in managing large OpenAPI
files by focusing only on the necessary parts for specific tasks.

## Usage

Example usage to make Open API file only for `/v1/quotes` and `/v1/users` APIs,
removing all others and also removing some DTOs:

```bash
openapi-trimmer -i openapi.yaml \
  -p /v1/quotes,/v1/users \
  -ec CompanyConfigDto,UpdateCompanyConfigDto
```

The output will be stored in `openapi-trimmer.yaml`

At the end validate with:

```bash
swagger-cli validate ./openapi-trimmer.yaml
```

## Install from PyPi

To install check the package on PyPi:
