# pylibCZIrw - Python wrapper for libCZI

This project provides a simple and easy-to-use Python wrapper for [libCZI](https://github.com/ZEISS/libczi) - a cross-platform C++ library intended for providing read and write access to CZI image documents.

## Important Remarks

* At the moment, **pylibCZIrw** completely abstracts away the subblock concept, both in the reading and in the writing APIs.
* The core concept of pylibCZIrw is focussing on reading and writing 2D image planes by specifying the dimension indices and its location in order to only read or write **what is really needed**.
* It allows reading data via http/https-protocol enabling cloud storage scenarios.

## Example Usage

```python
from pylibCZIrw import czi as pyczi

filepath = "myimagefile.czi"

# open the CZI document to read the
with pyczi.open_czi(filepath) as czidoc:
    # get the image dimensions as a dictionary, where the key identifies the dimension
    total_bounding_box = czidoc.total_bounding_box

    # get the total bounding box for all scenes
    total_bounding_rectangle = czidoc.total_bounding_rectangle

    # get the bounding boxes for each individual scene
    scenes_bounding_rectangle = czidoc.scenes_bounding_rectangle

    # read a 2D image plane and optionally specify planes, zoom levels and ROIs
    image2d = czidoc.read(plane={"T": 1, "Z": 2, "C": 0}, zoom=1.0, roi=(0, 0, 50, 100))
```

The detailed usage can be inferred from the [sample notebooks](https://github.com/ZEISS/pylibczirw/tree/main/doc/jupyter_notebooks).

## Installation
In case there is no wheel available for your system configuration, you can:  
- try to install from the provided source distribution  
  **For Windows**:
  - try to [keep paths short on systems with maximum path lengths](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3055)
  - make [Win10 accept file paths over 260 characters](https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/)
- reach out to the maintainers of this project to add more wheels
