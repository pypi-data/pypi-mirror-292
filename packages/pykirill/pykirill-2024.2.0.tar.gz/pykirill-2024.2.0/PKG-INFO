# üêó pykirill

[Documentation](https://kirilledition.github.io/pykirill/)

This is my personal Python package, `pykirill`, which includes a collection of utilities and functions that I frequently use during scientific exploration. This package is especially designed to be portable, making it suitable for environments like Google Colab where setup needs to be minimal.

## Installation

To install `pykirill`, you can use pip directly from GitHub. This method ensures you always get the latest version. Here are the steps to follow:

```bash
pip install pykirill
pip install git+https://github.com/kirilledition/pykirill.git
```

## Usage

Here are quick examples of how to use `pykirill`:

### Plotting
```python
from pykirill import plotting

plotting.setup()

axm = plotting.SubplotsManager(4)

for trajectory_fragment in range(4):
  frame_values = ...

  ax = axm.nextax()
  ax.hist(frame_values)
  ax.set_title(f"Histogram of intensity values of {trajectory_fragment}")
  ax.set_xlabel("Intensity")
  ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")

axm.show()
```

### Transforms
```python
from pykirill import transforms

# For NumPy arrays
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=np.float32)
log_scaled_x = transforms.log_scale(x)

# For Pandas DataFrames
log_scaled_df = df.apply(transforms.log_scale)
```
