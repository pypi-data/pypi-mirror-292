# Hexproof
A comprehensive library of Magic the Gathering API utilities. Standardized utilities and schemas for fetching and 
handling data from MTGJSON, Scryfall, and other Magic the Gathering data sources.

## What is it?
This acts as a submodule for my other project, the [hexproof.io API](https://github.com/Investigamer/hexproof.io).
I intend for this to be a standalone module that other developers can make use of in their own projects, so it will 
be maintained and published separately. Comprehensive documentation is planned in the near future.
