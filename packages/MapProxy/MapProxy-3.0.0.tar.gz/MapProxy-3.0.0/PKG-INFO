MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.

MapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.

MapProxy is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.

Changes
-------
3.0.0 2024-08-27
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Breaking:

  - Add proper XML Exception when service parameter disabled / invalid or missing
    In the past MapProxy returned WMS Capabilities when no explicit service parameter was given in
    GetCapabilities requests. With this change, an OGC exception will be returned instead.
    Invalid service types now also return a proper exception instead of an `internal error`.
    Besides, the status code of exception responses now have a 400 or 500 code instead of 200
    for better conformity.

Maintenance:

  - Add test for seeding sqlite cache
  - Documentation updates and clarifications
  - Dependency updates

Fixes:

  - Fix gh-pages workflow

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:
