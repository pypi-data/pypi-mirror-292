## PEER - Pytorch

Pytorch implementation of the PEER block from the Deepmind paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04153">Mixture of A Million Experts</a>, by Xu Owen He.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install PEER-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from PEER_pytorch import PEER

peer = PEER(
    dim = 512,
    heads = 8,                   # tested up to 32 - (hk = heads * num_experts_per_head (16))
    num_experts = 1_000_000,     # he chose 1 million
    num_experts_per_head = 16,   # he settled on 16, but was 32 in PKM paper
    dim_key = 128,
    pre_rmsnorm = True
).cuda()

x = torch.randn(2, 1024, 512).cuda()

out = peer(x) + x

assert x.shape == out.shape
```
