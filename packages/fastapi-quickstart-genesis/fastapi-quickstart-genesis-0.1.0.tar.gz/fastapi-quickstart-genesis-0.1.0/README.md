## Build wheel

1. First, let's install the necessary tools: `pip install setuptools wheel twine`
2. Now, let's try building the distribution files again: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
3. Before uploading to PyPI, it's a good practice to check your package: `twine check dist/*`
4. If everything looks good, you can upload to PyPI: `twine upload dist/*`

You'll be prompted for your PyPI username and password. If you haven't registered on PyPI yet, you'll need to do that first at https://pypi.org/account/register/

5. After uploading, you can install your package using pip: `pip install fastapi-quickstart`
