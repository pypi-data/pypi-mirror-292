Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


**When should I use iBridges instead of python-irodsclient/iCommands?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The python-irodsclient and the iCommands are much more powerful and expressive than iBridges. If you are already
intimately familiar with either of them, you probably don't need iBridges, since it doesn't add any functionality that isn't
already there.

The target audience of iBridges is different: it tries to help researchers/users that are not
expert iRODS users. The learning curve of using iBridges is much easier than either of the two alternatives.
Additionally, its simplicity and default checks makes it less likely you will end up with bad data.

An advantage compared to the iCommands is that iBridges also works on Mac OS and Windows.

**I have installed iBridges and now get "ibridges: command not found"**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This can happen for a variety for reasons, but the most common reason is that your PATH is not setup correctly on your system.
Often `pip` will complain about this when you install `ibridges`. To solve this, you must first find out where pip installs the
ibridges executable. Usually this will be something like `/home/your_username/.local/bin`, but this is dependent on your system. Then we must
add this to the path on the command line: `export PATH="${PATH}:/home/your_username/.local/bin"` (change the path according to your system). This should allow
your shell to find the `ibridges` command. You would have to type the previous command every time you start a new shell, which can be inconvenient.
To fix this permanently, add the command to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file in your home directory at the end of the file
(depending on your shell, type `echo ${SHELL}` to find out).


**Help, I'm getting a "NetworkError" while trying to transfer (large) files**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error is most likely to happen if you try to transfer a large file. The default timeout for iBridges is 25000 seconds,
which translates to roughly 7 hours. This should not cause issues during the actual transfer. However, if the calculation
of the checksum takes more than 7 hours (if the iRODS server is busy for example, or the file is many terabytes), then 
you will get a network error. The checksum itself should still be created. You can increase the timeout in your `irods_environment.json`
file by adding a new entry with :code:`"connection_timeout": 99999999999,`.
