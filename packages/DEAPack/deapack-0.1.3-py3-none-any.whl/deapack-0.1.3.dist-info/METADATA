# DEAPack: A Data Envelopment Analysis Package

DEAPack is a Python package designed for Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Its comprehensive toolset allows for efficient handling of various DEA models, including those that account for undesirable outputs.

## Installation

Install the package by `pip`,

```sh
pip install DEAPack
```
Or install the package by `conda`,
```sh
conda install DEAPack
```

## Usage

A brief example is provided below. For more information, please refer to the [documentation]() and [example notebooks]().

```python
# import the module
from DEAPack.model import DEA
from DEAPack.utilities import load_example_data

# load the example dataset
data = load_example_data()

# initilise a DEA model
model = DEA()

# specify the DEA model
model.DMUs = data['region']
model.time = data['year']
model.x_vars = data[['K', 'L', 'E']]
model.y_vars = data[['Y']]
model.b_vars = data[['CO2']]

# solve the DEA model
model.solve()

# get estimated efficiencies
results = model.get_efficiency()
```
