class AtomStereopermutator():
    """
          This class handles the permutation of ranked ligands around a central
          atom. It models its haptic ligands' binding sites and bridges in
          multidentate ligands in order to decide which stereopermutations are
          feasible. A stereopermutation may be infeasible, i.e. not realizable in
          three-dimensional space, if either haptic ligands would intersect due to
          too close ligand angles for their spatial heft, or if a multidentate
          ligand's bridge length between binding sites were too short to match the
          angle. The list of stereopermutations reduced by infeasible
          stereopermutations is then re-indexed and those indices into the list are
          called assignments.

          A Stereopermutator can be unassigned, i.e. the distinct stereopermutation
          that the substituents are can be indeterminate. If you choose to generate
          conformers for a molecule that includes unassigned stereopermutators,
          every conformer will choose an assignment from the pool of feasible
          assignments randomly, but consistent with relative statistical occurrence
          weights.

          Stereopermutator instances themselves are nonmodifiable. To change
          them, you have to make changes at the molecule level.

          state is propagated if the best mapping is unique, i.e. there are no

      DoNotPreserve : 
          Don't try to preserve chiral state. Changes at stereopermutators always

          It is important that you lower your expectations for the modeling of
          dihedral energy minima, however. Considering that Molassembler neither
          requires you to supply a correct graph, never detects or kekulizes
          aromatic systems nor asks you to supply an overall charge for a molecule,
          it should be understandable that the manner in which Molassembler decides
          where dihedral energy minima are is somewhat underpowered. The manner in
          which shape vertices are aligned in stereopermutation enumeration isn't
          even strictly based on a physical principle. We suggest the following to
          make the most of what the library can do for you:

          - Read the documentation for the various alignments. Consider using not
            just the default
            :class:`~scine_molassembler.BondStereopermutator.Alignment.Staggered`
            alignment, but either
            :class:`~scine_molassembler.BondStereopermutator.Alignemnt.EclipsedAndStaggered`
            or
            :class:`~scine_molassembler.BondStereopermutator.Alignment.BetweenEclipsedAndStaggered`
            to improve your chances of capturing all rotational minima. This will
            likely generate more conformers than strictly required, but should
            capture all minima.
          - Energy minimize all generated conformers with a suitable method and
            then deduplicate.
          - Consider using the
            :class:`~scine_molassembler.DirectedConformerGenerator.Relabeler` to do
            a final deduplication step.

              :warning: Invalidates all external atom and bond indices.

              Molecule instances can be canonicalized. Graph canonicalization is an
              algorithm that reduces all isomorphic forms of an input graph into a
              canonical form. After canonicalization, isomorphism tests are reduced to
              mere identity tests.

              The canonicalization itself, however, is computationally at least as
              expensive as an isomorphism itself. Therefore, no expense is saved if an
              isomorphism test is to be computed only once for two molecules by
              canonizing both. Only if a molecule instance is to be a repeated
              candidate for isomorphism tests is there value in canonizing it.

              This library takes the approach of adding a tag to molecules that
              identifies which components of the graph and stereocenters have been used
              in the generation of the canonical form. This tag is voided with the use
              of any non-const member function. Pay close attention to the

              you are making good use of the provided shortcuts.

              This permits detailed specification of which elements of the molecular

              Equality comparison is performed in several stages: First, at each atom
              position, a hash is computed that encompasses all local information that
              is specified to be used by the ``components_bitmask`` parameter. This

              an isomorphism that does not consider the specified factors.

              If an isomorphism is found, it is then validated. Bond orders and
              stereopermutators across both molecules are compared using the found
              isomorphism as an index map.
