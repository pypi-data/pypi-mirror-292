    **Bond discretization**

    In the discretization of fractional bond orders to classic integer internal
    bond types (e.g. single, double, etc.), there are two options. You can
    choose to round bond orders to the nearest integer, but this is
    particularly error prone for particularly weakly-bound metal ligands
    (around 0.5) and aromatic bonds (around 1.5). For instance, two adjacent
    aromatic bonds that both show a fractional bond order around 1.5 may be
    randomly rounded up or down depending on the bond order generation method
    or its particular conformation. This can cause unexpected ranking
    inequivalency / equivalency artifacts. If you expect there to be conjugated
    systems or transition metals in your set of interpreted molecules,
    discretizing bond orders in this fashion is currently disadvised.

    It can instead be preferable to discretize bond orders in a purely binary
    manner, i.e. bond orders are interpreted as a single bond if the fractional
    bond order is is more than or equal to 0.5. Double bond stereocenters (i.e.
    in organic molecules E/Z stereocenters) are still interpreted from
    coordinate information despite the main bond type discretized to a single
    bond.
