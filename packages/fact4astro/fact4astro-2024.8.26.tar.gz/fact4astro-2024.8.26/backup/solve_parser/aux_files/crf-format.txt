Notes

1 - All the 17 fields should be filled (with 0 when the information is 
    lacking).

2 - These three fields can be replaced by one field, giving the right 
    ascensions in degrees and decimal fraction (from 0. to 360.)

3 - These three fields can be replaced by one field, giving the declination 
    in degrees and decimal fraction (from -90. to +90.).

4 - The epoch of the catalog should be given in the general description of 
    the analysis.

5 - Any additional parameter(s) you feel appropriate to the description of
    the result.
