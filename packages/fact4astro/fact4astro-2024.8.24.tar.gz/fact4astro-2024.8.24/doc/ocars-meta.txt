#   1 -   8  OCARS (B1950) name; '#' in column 1 marks a comment line
#  10 -  19  J2000 name
#  21 -  37  right ascension, h, m, s
#  39 -  55  declination, d, m, s
#  57 -  66  error in right ascension, sec, not multiplied by cos(Dec)
#  68 -  76  error in declination, arcsec
#  78 -  84  RA/Dec correlation
#  86 -  93  semi-major axis of the error ellipse or 999.9999 if the actual value is >= 1", mas
#  95 -  96  catalog code (position reference), see ocars_p.txt for the explanation
#  98 - 104  epoch of the source coordinates, year
# 106 - 112  Galactic longitude, deg
# 114 - 120  Galactic latitude, deg
# 122        asterisk in this column shows that the following redshift is not from NED (see Notes field for detail)
# 123 - 128  redshift from NED (fiducial) or from the literature
# 129        redshift origin/quality flag:
#              s - spectroscopic
#              p - photometric
#              u - unreliable (doubtful, imaging, estimated, tentative, modeled, ...)
#              c - lower limit
#              d - upper limit
#              z - zero redshift assigned in OCARS for Galactic objects
# 131 - 136  redshift from SIMBAD
# 137        SIMBAD redshift origin/quality flag, the same meaning as above
# 139 - 144  redshift from SDSS
# 146 - 149  optical or NIR magnitude; primarily taken from the ocars_m.txt in
#              the following order of preference: VRGrgBiIzuUJHK; magnitude info
#              absent in ocars_m.txt is taken from NED quick-look data
# 150        band for which magnitude was measured;
#              magnitude without band index is an indicative NED value usually related to V or B band
# 152 - 153  object primary type:
#              A  - AGN, including unspecified QSO in NED
#              AB - blazar (replaced by other AGN class when known)
#              AL - BL Lac type
#              AQ - quasar
#              AR - LINER-type AGN
#              AS - Seyfert galaxy
#              A1 - Seyfert 1 galaxy
#              A2 - Seyfert 2 galaxy
#              G  - radio galaxy
#              G2 - double or multiple galaxy
#              I  - IR source
#              R  - radio source
#              S  - star or stellar object
#              SN - supernova (remnant)
#              U  - UV source
#              V  - visual source
#              X  - X-ray source
#              GR - gamma-ray source
# 155 - (1024 max)   object names and notes;
#              question mark in column 156 means that no counterpart was found neither in NED nor in SIMBAD;
#              name started with column 156 means questionable identification, as well as question mark after name;
#              double semicolon, when present, ends the list of source IDs when followed by other notes
