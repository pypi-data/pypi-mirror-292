# Fundamental Astrometric Catalog Tools (FACT)

A Python package for processing fundamental astrometric catalogs used in our group.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/fact.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/fact)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Features

- Parse and process fundamental astrometric catalogs like ICRF3.
<!-- - Compare different catalogs and compute positional and proper motion differences.
- Analyze VLBI global solutions and products.
- Perform catalog analyses using vector spherical harmonics (VSH). -->

## Modules

- **cat_parser**: Read commonly used astrometric catalogs, for example, ICRF3 catalogs.
<!-- - **cat_utils**: Compare different catalogs and compute the position and proper motion differences.
- **solve_parser**: Read the output files of the VLBI global solution generated by the Calc/Solve software.
- **vlbi_tools**: Parse different kinds of VLBI products mainly available at [Paris Observatory Geodetic VLBI Center](https://ivsopar.obspm.fr/)(OPAR).
- **vsh**: Perform catalog analyses based on the vector spherical harmonics (VSH). -->

## Installation

You can install FACT using pip from PyPI:

```bash
pip install fact
```

## Requirements

When you install FACT via pip, the necessary dependencies will be automatically installed. These include any libraries required for the core functionalities of the package.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the cat_parser module to read an ICRF3 catalog:
```
from fact.cat_parser import read_icrf3

icrf3_data = read_icrf3("path_to_icrf3_catalog")
print(icrf3_data)
```

More detailed examples and usage guidelines will be available in the manual, which is currently under development.

## Documentation

The manual is under development and will be available soon. We encourage users to provide feedback and suggestions to help improve the package and its documentation.
