The ``python-project-stub`` codebase provides stub files that
can be used to create a Python project that is able to
be packaged and uploaded to the Python Package Index
and hence can be conveniently installed with

.. code-block:: sh
   
   pip install my-project-name
   
The ``Makefile`` provided in the codebase has targets for
building, uploading,
downloading, installing, and executing the package.
