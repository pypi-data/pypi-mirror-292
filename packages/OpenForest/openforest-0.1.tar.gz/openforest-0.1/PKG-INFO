# OpenForest

**OpenForest** is a comprehensive Python toolkit designed to provide a variety of functionalities, including server setup, file operations, data transformations, GUI components, and more. This project aims to streamline development with a set of useful tools and utilities.

## Features

- **Flask Server Setup**: Simple method to start a local server with error handling and logging.
- **File Operations**: Practical methods for reading and writing files with robust exception handling.
- **Pipeline and Transformations**: Includes a `Pipeline` method for processing user input and applying transformations like Uppercase, Lowercase, and StripSpace.
- **LoadingBar**: Progress bar and spinner for visual feedback during long-running operations.
- **GetImage**: Method for downloading and saving images with URL validation and content checks.
- **GUI Components**: Tkinter-based GUI with functionalities such as buttons, labels, sliders, and a file dialog.
- **BasicWords**: Simple chatbot responses with potential for integration with more complex NLP.
- **Custom Decorators**: Versatile decorators including After, Before, Around, Replace, Retry, Cache, and RateLimit.

## Installation

To use OpenForest, you need Python 3.6 or higher. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Flask Server

Start the local server with:

```python
from OpenForest import LocalHost

LocalHost()
```

### File Operations

Read from a file:

```python
from OpenForest import read_file

content = read_file('example.txt')
```

Write to a file:

```python
from OpenForest import write_file

write_file('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')
```

### Pipeline and Transformations

Use the `Pipeline` method for data processing:

```python
from OpenForest import Pipeline

result = Pipeline(input_data, transformations)
```

### LoadingBar

Show a progress bar:

```python
from OpenForest import LoadingBar

LoadingBar.show_progress(iterable, delay=0.1)
```

### GetImage

Download and save an image:

```python
from OpenForest import GetImage

GetImage.download_image('http://example.com/image.jpg', 'local_image.jpg')
```

### Tkinter GUI

Create a GUI with buttons, labels, and more:

```python
from OpenForest import OpenGui

gui = OpenGui()
gui.run()
```

### BasicWords

Chatbot responses example:

```python
from OpenForest import BasicWords

response = BasicWords.get_response('Hello')
```

### Custom Decorators

Use custom decorators:

```python
from OpenForest.decorators import Retry

@Retry(retries=3)
def my_function():
    pass
```
