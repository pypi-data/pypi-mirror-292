# PygButtons
A module made to help create a UI in pygame by simplifying the creation and handling of basic UI objects (such as Buttons).

## Installation
To install, run: `pip install pygbuttons`

## Dependencies
- Python => 3.8
- Pygame => 2.0.1

## Usage
To use the Buttons in a program, it is recommended to perform the following steps:
- Setup
  1. Import the module / the contents of the module.
  2. Set the settings for the Buttons module (framerate, scroll factor, scaling limits) where appropriate
  3. Create the required Buttons
- While running
  1. Pass all (relevant) Pygame.Events to the active Buttons in the input loop
  2. Draw the Buttons to the active screen
  3. Repeat

Getting an output from a Button can be done either by binding a function to the Button (which is then automatically executed when a certain action takes place), or by polling the Buttons value / status.

For a practical implementation, see the [example.py](https://github.com/Jarno-de-Wit/PygButtons/blob/main/Example.py) file.
