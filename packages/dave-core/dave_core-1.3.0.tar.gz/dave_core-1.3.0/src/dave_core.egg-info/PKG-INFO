DAVE_core
=========




DAVE is an softwaretool for a automatic generation of region-specific energy grid models. The resulting grid models are based on open data from different sources.


This code ist based on and explained in the following publicationat :

- `Banze, T., Kneiske, T.M. Open data for energy networks: introducing DAVEâ€”a data fusion tool for automated network generation. Sci Rep 14, 1938 (2024). <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52199-w>`_

More on DAVE is published on the webside http://databutler.energy


Installation
============

::

    pip install dave_core

You can also install the in-development version with::

    pip install https://github.com/DaveFoss/DAVE_core/archive/main.zip


Documentation
=============

Development
===========

To run all the tests run::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 90
    :stub-columns: 1

    - - Windows
      - ::

            set PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append
            tox

    - - Other
      - ::

            PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append tox
