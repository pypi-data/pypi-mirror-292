# ðŸ§¬ Tau Fibrils Yolo - Object detection in Cryo-EM images

![screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)

We provide a [YoloV8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) model for the detection of oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) of Tau fibrils in Cryo-EM images.

[[`Installation`](#installation)] [[`Model`](#model)] [[`Usage`](#usage)]

This project is part of a collaboration between the [EPFL Center for Imaging](https://imaging.epfl.ch/) and the [Laboratory of Biological Electron Microscopy](https://www.lbem.ch/).

## Installation

### As a standalone app

Download and run the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/EPFL-Center-for-Imaging/tau-fibrils-yolo/releases) page.

### As a Python package

We recommend performing the installation in a clean Python environment. Install our package from PyPi:

```sh
pip install tau-fibrils-yolo
```

or from the repository:

```sh
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/center-for-imaging/tau-fibrils-object-detection.git
```

or clone the repository and install with:

```sh
git clone git+https://gitlab.com/center-for-imaging/tau-fibrils-object-detection.git
cd tau-fibrils-yolo
pip install -e .
```

## Model

The model weights (6.5 Mb) are automatically downloaded from [this repository on Zenodo](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/records/99113) the first time you run inference. The model files are saved in the user home folder in the `.yolo` directory.

## Usage

**In Napari**

To use our model in Napari, start the viewer with

```sh
napari -w tau-fibrils-yolo
```

or open the Napari menu bar and select `Plugins > Tau fibrils detection`.

Open an image using `File > Open files` or drag-and-drop an image into the viewer window.

**Sample data**: To test the model, you can run it on our provided sample image. In Napari, open the image from `File > Open Sample > [TODO - add a sample image]`.


**As a library**

You can run the model to detect fibrils in an image (represented as a numpy array).

```py
from tau_fibrils_yolo import FibrilsDetector

detector = FibrilsDetector()

boxes, probabilities = detector.predict(your_image)
```

**As a CLI**

Run inference on an image from the command-line. For example:

```sh
tau_fibrils_predict_image -i /path/to/folder/image_001.tif
```

The command will save the segmentation next to the image:

```
folder/
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_001.tif
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_001_results.csv
```

Optionally, you can use the `-r` flag to also rescale the image by a given factor.

To run inference in batch on all images in a folder, use:

```sh
tau_fibrils_predict_folder -i /path/to/folder/
```

This will produce:

```
folder/
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_001.tif
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_001_results.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_002.tif
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_002_results.csv
```

## Acknowledgements

We would particularly like to thank **Valentin Vuillon** for annotating the images on which this model was trained, and for developing the preliminary code that laid the foundation for this image analysis project.
