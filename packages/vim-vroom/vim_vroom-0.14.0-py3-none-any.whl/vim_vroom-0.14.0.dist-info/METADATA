              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Vroom: Launch vim tests

![Vroom](/images/vroom_logo.png?raw=true)

![usage screencast](/images/usage_screencast.gif)

_**Vroom is experimental.** There are still some issues with vim that we
haven't figured out how to work around. We reserve the right to make backwards
incompatible changes in order to address these._

Vroom is for testing vim.

Let's say you're a vimscript author. You want to test your new plugin. You could
find a nice vimscript test suite, but that only lets you test your vimscript
functions. What you really want is a way to specify vim commands — actual input
keys that that the user hits — and then verify vim's output.

Enter vroom.

    This is a vroom test.

      > iHello, world!<ESC>
      Hello, world!

The above vroom test opens vim, sends the keys `iHello, world!<ESC>` and then
verifies that the contents of the current buffer is `Hello, world!`.

Things can get much more complex than this, of course. You need to be able to
check the output of multiple buffers. You need to check what messages your
functions echo. You need to sandbox vim, capture its system commands, and
respond with dummy data. And a few shortcuts would be nice.

Never fear! Vroom has it all. Check the examples for details and more
documentation. examples/basics.vroom is a good place to start.

Run `vroom -h` to learn about vroom's configuration options.

Did you accidentally set off a giant vroom test that's running too fast to halt?
Never fear! Pop open another terminal and `vroom --murder`.
Make sure the `--servername` flag matches with the vroom you're trying to kill.
You may need to run `reset` in the terminal with the murdered vroom.

See the
[Tips and Tricks page](https://github.com/google/vroom/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks)
page for some strategies for getting the most out of vroom.

## Usage

Vroom is invoked from the command-line on `.vroom` files. Here are some
examples of usage:

* Running a single file, native vim runner (must have `+clientserver` enabled):

  ```sh
  vroom myplugin/vroom/somefile.vroom --servername=FOO
  ```

* With native vim, finding files below current directory:

  ```sh
  vroom --crawl --servername=FOO`
  ```

* With neovim (must have installed both neovim and neovim python plugin):

  ```sh
  vroom --crawl --neovim --servername=FOO
  ```

* Without running setup.py and with neovim, assuming curdir=vroom repo root:

  ```sh
  PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 vroom/__main__.py --neovim --crawl --servername=FOO`
  ```

See `vroom --help` and https://github.com/google/vroom/wiki for more info on
usage.

## Installation

Note that Vroom requires a version of vim built with the `+clientserver`
option (run `vim --version` to check).  See `:help clientserver` for
additional requirements.

If you're on Ubuntu or Debian, you can install
[release packages](https://github.com/google/vroom/releases) from GitHub.

Otherwise, the easiest way to install vroom is to clone the vroom repository
from GitHub, cd into the vroom directory, and run
```sh
python3 setup.py build && sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Vim 7.4.384 and later have built-in syntax support for the vroom filetype. You
can install the standalone
[ft-vroom plugin](https://github.com/google/vim-ft-vroom) for older versions of
vim.

## Vroom cheat sheet

Below is a table of the special symbols and conventions vroom recognizes. See
the files under [examples/](examples/) and in particular
[examples/basics.vroom](examples/basics.vroom) for explanations.

<!-- Note for editors: the code spans below use NO-BREAK SPACE characters to
render literal spaces -->
| Symbol  | Description     | Action          | Example                   | Controls                             |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
|         | unindented line | comment         | `This is a comment`       |                                      |
| `  > `  | gt leader       | input           | `  > iHello, world!<ESC>` | `(N.Ns)` (delay)                     |
| `  :`   | colon leader    | command         | `  :echomsg 'A message'`  | `(N.Ns)` (delay)                     |
| `  % `  | percent leader  | text            | `  % Sent to buffer`      | `(N.Ns)` (delay)                     |
| `  `    | 2-space indent  | output (buffer) | `  Compared to buffer`    | `(N)` (buf number)                   |
| `  & `  | ampersand       | output          | `  & :LiteralText`        | `(N)` (buf number)                   |
| `  ~ `  | tilde leader    | message         | `  ~ Echo'd!`             | match modes<br>(default: verbatim)   |
| `  \|`  | pipe leader     | continuation    | `  \|…TO A BIGGER HOUSE!` |                                      |
| `  ! `  | bang leader     | system          | `  ! echo From Vim`       | match modes<br>(default: regex)      |
| `  $ `  | dollar leader   | hijack          | `  $ Nope, from vroom`    | output channels<br>(default: stdout) |
| `  @`   | at leader       | directive       | `  @clear`                | varies                               |

Special controls:

  * match modes (for message and system): `(verbatim)`, `(glob)`, `(regex)`
  * output channels (for hijack): `(stdout)`, `(stderr)`, `(status)`, `(command)`

Vroom also supports several built-in directives. See
[examples/directives.vroom](examples/directives.vroom) and
[examples/macros.vroom](examples/macros.vroom) for explanations.

Directives:

  * `@clear` — Clear buffer contents (also triggered by 3 blank vroom lines).
  * `@end` — Ensure buffer matching reached end of buffer lines.
  * `@messages` — Override strictness for unexpected messages.
  * `@system` — Override strictness for unexpected system calls.
  * `@macro` — Define vroom macro.
  * `@endmacro` — End vroom macro and resume normal vroom processing.
  * `@do` — Invoke vroom macro defined with `@macro`.

## Neovim mode

By default, vroom uses vim to execute vroom files. You can instead invoke it
with the `--neovim` flag to execute vroom files inside neovim.

To use it, you need to install the neovim-mode dependencies:

  * Install neovim for your platform according to the directions at
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing.
  * Install [neovim/python-client](https://github.com/neovim/python-client):
```sh
sudo pip3 install neovim
```

## Travis CI

You can configure your vim plugin's vroom files to be tested continuously in
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).

Just create a .travis.yml file at the root of your repository. The particulars
may vary for your plugin, but here's an example configuration:

```YAML
language: generic
before_script:
  # Install your desired version of vroom.
  - wget https://github.com/google/vroom/releases/download/v0.12.0/vroom_0.12.0-1_all.deb
  - sudo dpkg -i vroom_0.12.0-1_all.deb
  # Install vim.
  - sudo apt-get install vim-gnome
  # Vroom's vim mode currently requires a running X server.
  - export DISPLAY=:99.0
  - sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start
  # If your plugin depends on maktaba, clone maktaba into a sibling directory.
  - git clone https://github.com/google/vim-maktaba.git ../maktaba/
script:
  - vroom --crawl ./vroom/
```

It's also possible to test your plugin against neovim, but the recommended
instructions are still being finalized. Details coming soon.

## Known issues

Vroom uses vim as a server. Unfortunately, we don't yet have a reliable way to
detect when vim has finished processing commands. Vroom currently relies upon
arbitrary delays. As such, tests run more slowly than is necessary. Furthermore,
some lengthy commands in vroom tests require additional arbitrary delays in
order to make the tests pass.

We're still looking for workarounds. (If you, like us, wish vim had a sane
client/server architecture, consider
[supporting](https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/539-neovim-first-iteration)
[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).)
