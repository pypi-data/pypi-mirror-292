## Introduction
`langflow-streamlit` is a powerful API that bridges the gap between [Langflow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) applications. This library seamlessly integrates Langflow's advanced language processing capabilities with Streamlit's user-friendly interface, enabling developers to create interactive applications that harness the power of sophisticated language models.

**Important:** To use this library effectively, you need to set up a Langflow Store Key. This key allows you to access and use flows and components from the Langflow Store. For more information on setting up your Langflow Store Key, please refer to the [Langflow documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/configuration-api-keys).

## Features

- **Seamless Integration:** Effortlessly establish communication between Langflow and Streamlit with minimal configuration.
- **Streamlined Deployment:** Quickly install and run the API using either `pip` or `poetry`.
- **Flexible Execution Options:** Choose to run the full stack (Langflow + Streamlit API) or just the Streamlit backend with API.
- **Langflow Store Integration:** Access and utilize pre-built flows and Streamlit components from the Langflow Store to enhance your applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
## Installation

### Option 1: Install via pip

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install langflow-streamlit==0.1.8
```

### Option 2: Clone the repository and use Poetry

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yaitec/langflow-streamlit.git
   cd langflow-streamlit
   ```

2. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### How to run

<details>
<summary>If choose <a href="#option-1-install-via-pip">pip installation</a> option</summary>

1. Run the full stack (Langflow, API, and Streamlit):
   ```bash
   python -m langflow-streamlit run
   ```

2. Run only the Streamlit backend and API:
   ```bash
   python -m langflow-streamlit run --streamlit-only
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>If choose <a href="#option-2-clone-the-repository-and-use-poetry">clone the repository</a> option</summary>

1. Run the full stack (Langflow, API, and Streamlit):
   ```bash
   make start
   ```

2. Run only the Streamlit backend and API:
   ```bash
   make start-streamlit-only
   ```
</details>
<br/>

**Note:** Running only the Streamlit backend is useful when you want to use Langflow-created flows in your Streamlit application without running the full Langflow instance.

#### How to open each aplication(after running the project)

Open the URLs below in your browser
- **Streamlit Chat:**: Available at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).
- **Streamlit API:** The API Documentation can abe accessed at [http://localhost:7881/docs](http://localhost:7881/docs).
- **Langflow:** Available at [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860).

</p>


### Streamlit Components

Langflow provides pre-built Streamlit components that can be accessed through the Langflow store. These components enhance your Streamlit applications with powerful functionality:

- **[Send](./send.md)**: Send messages to a Streamlit chat session.
- **[Listen](./listen.md)**: Listen for incoming messages in a Streamlit chat, dynamically updating the layout of the Streamlit application.

To use these components:
1. Access the Langflow store within your Langflow instance.
2. Search for and download the desired Streamlit component.
3. Integrate the component into your Langflow workflow.
4. Connect the component to your Streamlit application using the `langflow-streamlit` API.

For detailed instructions on using Streamlit components, refer to the [Usage](#usage) section below.

## Environment Variables

| Variable       | Description                                                   | Default |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| STREAMLIT_ONLY | If True, runs only Streamlit and Streamlit API; else, runs Langflow too | False   |
| LOG_LEVEL | Defines log level of library | "info" |
| LOG_FILE_GENERATION | If True, creates a langflow-streamlit.log file for debug purpose and overrides LOG_LEVEL to 'debug' | False |

### Setting Environment Variables
You can learn how to set environment variables for each alternative bellow, click in the arrow that correlated to installation option that you choosed and check how to setup it properly.

<details>
<summary>If you choose <a href="#option-1-install-via-pip">pip installation</a> option</summary>
these are the options that you can set:

   ```bash
   langflow-streamlit --streamlit-only --log-level error --log-file-generation
   ```
</details>
<details>
<summary>If you choose <a href="#option-2-clone-the-repository-and-use-poetry">clone the repository</a> option</summary>

- Setting it in zsh or bash

   ```bash
   export STREAMLIT_ONLY=True LOG_LEVEL=debug LOG_FILE_GENERATION=True
   ```

- Setting it in PowerShell

   ```powershell
   $env:STREAMLIT_ONLY = "True"
   $env:LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
   $env:LOG_FILE_GENERATION = "True"
   ```
