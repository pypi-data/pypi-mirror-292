    Configuration for HTTP/1.1 proxy transport sockets. This is intended for
    use in Envoy Mobile, though may eventually be extended for upstream Envoy
    use. If this transport socket is configured, and an intermediate filter
    adds the stream info necessary for proxying to the stream info (as the test
    filter does :repo:`here
    <test/integration/filters/header_to_proxy_filter.cc>`) then * Upstream
    connections will be directed to the specified proxy address rather   than
    the host's address * Upstream TLS connections will have a raw HTTP/1.1
    CONNECT header prefaced   to the payload, and 200 response stripped (if
    less than 200 bytes) * Plaintext HTTP/1.1 connections will be sent with a
    fully qualified URL. This transport socket is not compatible with HTTP/3,
    plaintext HTTP/2, or raw TCP.
