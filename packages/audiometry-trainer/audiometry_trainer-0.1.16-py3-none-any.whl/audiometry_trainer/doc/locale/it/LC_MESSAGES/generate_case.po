"To generate a new case file click on the ``File`` menu and then on "
"``Generate case``. The ``generate case`` window will open up. Cases are "
"generated on the basis of psychometric function (PF) parameters for bone "
"conduction (BC) thresholds and air-bone gaps (ABGs). PF parameters for "
"air-conduction (AC) responses are internally generated by the software on"
" the basis of the BC parameters and of the ABGs. For example, the AC PF "
"midpoint is equal to the BC PF midpoint plus the ABG. The false alarm and"
" the lapse rate for AC responses are assumed to be the same as those for "
"BC responses. When you generate a case, virtual listener thresholds are "
"simulated over a large number of iterations to obtain the median "
"thresholds and the 95% confidence intervals that are shown by clicking "
"the ``Show actual threshold`` checkboxes in the main "
"``audiometry_trainer`` window. Please see Section :ref:`sec-"
"virtual_listener` for further details on PFs."

"The virtual listener parameters are specified using a spreadsheet-like "
"interface in which each row represents a different frequency. Frequencies"
" can be added/removed by clicking on the ``Edit`` menu and then on "
"``Frequencies``. Only a discrete set of frequencies between 0.125 and 8 "
"kHz can be used. Selecting with the mouse multiple cells and right "
"clicking allows you to copy/cut/paste cell values as well as set the same"
" value for all selected cells."

"Some abbreviations are used in the column headers of the ``generate "
"case`` window to save space: `mdp` for midpoint, `F.A.` for false alarm, "
"`R` for right and `L` for left. To give some concrete usage examples, if "
"you wanted to simulate a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB HL at a "
"given frequency you could set the BC midpoint of the PF to around 43 dB "
"HL, the PF width to around 8 dB, and the ABG to zero. The midpoint is the"
" point at which the listener responds \"Yes\" 50% of the time (assuming "
"F.A. and lapse rates close to zero). The threshold found with the "
"Hughson-Westlake procedure is found at a %Yes responses between 50% and "
"100%. A width of 8 dB means that the PF will go from 5% to 95% correct in"
" the span of 8 dB, therefore it will go from the midpoint (43 dB HL) to "
"95% \"Yes\", in the span of 4 dB (half the width). Overall, using these "
"parameters the threshold will be located within a couple of dB of 45 dB "
"HL. Given that a step size of 5 dB is used for the threshold search, the "
"resulting threshold will almost certainly be found, on average, at 45 dB "
"HL. This is simply an example and variations of each of the PF parameters"
" (midpoint, width, F.A. rate and lapse rate) could be used to obtain a "
"virtual listener with the same threshold but a different response "
"behavior. Empirically, the region of uncertainty between inaudibility and"
" certain detection in clinical audiometry has been found to be around 10 "
"dB wide [Barr-HamiltonEtAl1969]_, therefore PF widths of around 10 dB "
"should result in relatively realistic virtual listeners."

"To simulate a conductive/mixed hearing loss simply set the ABG to the "

"In addition to the BC and ABG PF parameters there are two columns, ``Gain"
" R`` and ``Gain L`` that represent the gain of a hearing aid worn by the "
"virtual listener. The values in these columns do not have any influence "
"on the listener's responses to stimuli delivered via earphones or via the"
" bone conduction transducer. They only influence free-field responses. "
"Free-field responses are not currently implemented in "
"``audiometry_trainer`` but may be implemented in the future, so for now "
"you can simply leave the ``Gain R`` and ``Gain L`` cells values to their "
"default value of zero."
