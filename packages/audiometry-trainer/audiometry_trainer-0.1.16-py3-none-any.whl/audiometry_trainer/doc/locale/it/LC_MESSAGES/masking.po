"For masking during bone conduction audiometry, additionnally, the ``Non-"
"test ear status`` has to be set to ``Earphone on`` (otherwise the "
"software considers that the noise is being played through the earphone, "
"but the earphone is not on the listener's ear, so no noise actually "
"arrives at the listener's ear). ``audiometry_trainer`` automatically sets"
" the ``Non-test ear status`` to ``Earphone on`` when you check the "
"``Chan. 2 ON`` checkbox. This small complication for masking in bone "
"conduction audiometry is due to the fact that ``audiometry_trainer`` lets"
" you test bone conduction thresholds either with the NTE uncovered, or "
"with the NTE covered by the earphone while the earphone is not playing "
"any noise. This is useful to measure the size of the occlusion effect "
"(see :ref:`subsubsec-measure_OE`)."

"Some authors (e.g. [Gelfand2016]_) recommend measuring the OE in "
"individual listeners to determine the value to be used in masking "
"formulas. This can be done by covering the NTE with the earphone and "
"measuring BC thresholds, without presenting any masking noise to the NTE."
" The thresholds obtained in this \"earphones ON\" condition can then be "
"compared to those obtained without covering the NTE to estimate the "
"magnitude of the occlusion effect [MartinEtAl1974]_. To obtain BC "
"thresholds with the NTE covered by an earphone, but without delivery of "
"masking noise, in ``audiometry_trainer`` you need to set the ``Non-test "
"ear status`` to ``Earphones ON`` and make sure that the ``Chan. 2 ON`` "
"checkbox is uncheked. The size of the OE measured in this way will depend"
" on the earphones used for ``Chan. 2``, so make sure that you select the "
"same earphone type that will be later used to deliver the masking noise."

"A limitation of this technique is that in some cases it can underestimate"
" the size of the OE ([FagelsonAndMartin1994]_; [Yacullo1997]_). This may "
"happen in the case of a listener with NTE BC thresholds close to the "
"lower output limits of the BC vibrator. For example, if the listener has "
"a BC threshold of 0 dB HL and the BC vibrator has a lower output level "
"limit of -20 dB HL, then OEs larger than 20 dB would be underestimated. "
"This may also happen if the TE BC threshold is lower than the NTE BC "
"threshold. Suppose for example that the TE BC threshold is 20 dB HL, the "
"NTE BC threshold is 30 dB HL, and the NTE OE is 30 dB. The threshold "
"recorded in the unoccluded condition will be 20 dB HL and when the NTE is"
" occluded the threshold recorded will be 0 dB HL; the difference between "
"the two, the estimated OE, will be 20 dB rather than the actual NTE OE of"
" 30 dB. If masking is used only to confirm that the unmasked TE BC "
"threshold is genuine, underestimating the OE will be of no consequence; "
"the TE had the lowest threshold to start with, so undermasking will "
"simply confirm, \"in the wrong way\", a correct decision that that "
"threshold was coming from the TE. If the estimated OE is used for a full-"
"blown masked threshold search, the masked TE BC threshold may be lower "
"than the unmasked one because the NTE will be undermasked."
