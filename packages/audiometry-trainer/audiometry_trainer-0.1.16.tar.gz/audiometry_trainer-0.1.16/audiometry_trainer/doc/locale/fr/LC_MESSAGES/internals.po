"in particular the `thresh_status` key ``` self.plot_prms['masked']"
"['bone']['right']['thresh_status'] ``` is used to differentiate between "
"points marked as thresholds ('found' key), no responses at the maximum "
"level ('NR' key), and masking dilemmas ('MD' key). Note that in each of "
"these cases the stimulus level at which the cursor is located when "
"marking the threshold will be stored in `self.est_aud`. The "
"`thresh_status` key in the `self.plot_prms` dict allows to treat them "
"differently according to the cases seen above."
