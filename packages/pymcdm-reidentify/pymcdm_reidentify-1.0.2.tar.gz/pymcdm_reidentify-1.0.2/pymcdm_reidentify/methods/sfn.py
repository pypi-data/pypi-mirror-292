    """ Abstract class for Stochastic Fuzzy Normalization (SFN).

        SFN is an approach for the re-identification of MCDA/MCDM models using fuzzy numbers. The main concept involves
        finding values within the fuzzy numbers, known as cores, while keeping the boundary values of the fuzzy numbers
        constant.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : callable
            A function used for optimization to find the best cores. It should include 'bounds', which denote the
            search boundaries for the cores; these boundaries are projected onto a FloatVar object from the MealPy
            library. The function should also include an argument to set 'obj_func', which is used according to the
            fuzzy normalization selection methodology. Additionally, it should have an argument to set 'minmax',
            which determines whether the function is minimized or maximized. It should also have an argument to set
            'n_dims', which indicates the number of criteria in the decision-making problem.

        base : object
            An object representing the MCDA/MCDM method for which the cores will be found. It should have a
            'normalization' attribute and be callable for evaluating alternatives (in this case, the training set).

        weights : ndarray, optional
            Criteria weights. The sum of the weights should be 1 (e.g., sum(weights) == 1). If not provided, the weights
            are assigned equally in the 'fit' method.
