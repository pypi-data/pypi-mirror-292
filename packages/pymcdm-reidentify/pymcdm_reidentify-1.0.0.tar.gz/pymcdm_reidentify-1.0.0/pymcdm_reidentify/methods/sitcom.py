    """ Stochastic IdenTification Of Models (SITCOM) approach.

        SITCOM is an approach based on determining the preferences of characteristic objects using the COMET method
        through stochastic optimization methods. The main advantage of this approach is the ability to re-identify the
        COMET model without re-engaging the decision-making expert [#sitcom1]_, [#sitcom2]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : callable
            A function used for optimization to find the best preferences of characteristic objects. It should include
            'bounds', which denote the search boundaries for the preferences; these boundaries are projected onto a
            FloatVar object from the MealPy library. The function should also include an argument to set 'obj_func',
            which is used according to the preferences of characteristics objects selection methodology. Additionally,
            it should have an argument to set 'minmax', which determines whether the function is minimized or maximized.
            It should also have an argument to set 'n_dims', which indicates the number of characteristic objects in
            the decision-making problem.

        cvalues : list[list]
            A list of characteristic values based on which characteristic objects are created for the SITCOM model. Each
            criterion should have at least two characteristic values, which should be provided in a nested list.
