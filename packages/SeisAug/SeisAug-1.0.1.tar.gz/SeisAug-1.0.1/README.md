# SeisAug: A Comprehensive Data Augmentation Python Toolkit for Deep Learning

The **SeisAug** toolkit addresses a significant challenge in seismological studies: the limited availability of region- and depth-specific labeled data. This scarcity poses a preliminary drawback when applying deep learning and machine learning techniques. To enhance model performance, we propose data augmentation as a simple yet effective solution.
