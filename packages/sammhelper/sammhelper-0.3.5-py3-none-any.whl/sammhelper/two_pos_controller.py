    """
    Creates a two position controller to adjust the parameters of the input ODE function,
    calculates the controlled variable x with the adjusted parameters.

    Args:
        model (callable(y,t,...)): The function computes the derivative of y at t.
        time (array): A sequence of time points for which to solve for y.
        xlimit (list): Setpoints for controlled variable x.
        ylimit (list): Setpoints for control member y (actuator).
        Tt (float): Specified dead time.
        
        x_ind (int, optional): Index of the controlled element x in var0. Default is -1.
        y_ind (int, optional): Index of control member y in param. Default is -1.
        
        n (int, optional): For a cascade of CSTRS, number of total CSTRs n. Default is 1.
        n_meas (int,optional): The reactor in which the controlled variable x measured. Default is the last reactor.
    
    Returns:
        results: The solved differential equation using the controller.
        y_final: The log of the adjusted control member y.
