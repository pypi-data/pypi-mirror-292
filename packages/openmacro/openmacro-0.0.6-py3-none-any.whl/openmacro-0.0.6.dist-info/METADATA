# openmacro
> [!NOTE]  
> Project is in its early stage of development.

openmacro is a multiplatform personal agent which allows LLMs to run code locally. Open Macro aims to act as a personal agent capable of completing and automating simple to complex tasks autonomously via self prompting.

### Get started
You can get started with openmacro by running.
```shell
pip install openmacro
```
> Not working? Raise an issue [here](https://github.com/amooo-ooo/openmacro/issues/new).
```shell
macro
```

This provides a cli natural-language interface and toolset for you to:

+ Complete and automate simple to complex tasks.
+ Analyse and plot data.
+ ~~Control a Chromium browser to perform tasks and research.~~
+ Control desktop applications through vision and pyautogui.
+ Manipulate files including photos, videos, PDFs, etc.

By default, if no api keys for models are provided, the following will be used powered by HuggingFace:
+ LLM: [Llama3.1-70B](https://huggingface.co/spaces/orionai/llama-3.1-70b-demo)
+ Code: [CodeQwen1.5-7B](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/CodeQwen1.5-7b-Chat-demo)
+ Vision: [Qwen-VL-Max](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen-VL-Max)

This project is heavily inspired by Open Interpreter.
