# Image Download

Please follow the tutorial in [DownloadImagesDemo.py](https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS/blob/master/docs/datacollection/DownloadImagesDemo.py)

You'll have to register your own account on Google Cloud and get your Google Maps API key.

Put this key in [DownloadImagesDemo.py](https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS/blob/master/docs/datacollection/DownloadImagesDemo.py)

Note that calling Google API costs money. 

For satellite images, the price is $2 per 1,000 images.

For street view images, the price is $7 per 1,000 images.

But the good thing is the first $200 per month is on Google:
