# iDDN

We developed an efficient and accurate multi-omics differential network analysis tool 
â€“ integrative Differential Dependency Networks (iDDN).
iDDN is capable of jointly learning sparse common and rewired network structures, 
which is especially useful for genomics, proteomics, and other biomedical studies.
This repository provides the source code and examples of using iDDN.


![iDDN overview](https://github.com/cbil-vt/iDDN/blob/main/src/iddn_data/iddn_overview.png?raw=true)

## Installation
### Option 1: install from PyPI
iDDN can then be installed with the following command.
```bash
pip install iddn
```
<!-- ```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple iddn
``` -->

If you meet any issue, one way is to install iDDN into a new Conda environment. 
To create and activate an environment named `iddn`, run this:
```bash
conda create -n iddn python=3.11
conda activate iddn
```
Then run `pip install iddn`.

### Option 2: install the development version

Alternatively, you can clone the repository, or just download or unzip it. Then we can install DDN 3.0.
```bash
$ pip install ./
```
Or you may want to install it in development mode.
```bash
$ pip install -e ./
```

## Usage

This toy example applies iDDN on a synthetic data. More details can be found in the first tutorial.
```python
from iddn import tools  # Run iDDN algorithm and process the output
from iddn_data import load_data  # Load example data and images
example = load_data.load_example("example.npz")
dat1 = example["dat1"]
dat2 = example["dat2"]
dep_mat = example["dep_mat"]
result = tools.iddn_basic_pipeline(dat1, dat2, dep_mat, lambda1=0.15, lambda2=0.05)
```

For more details and examples, check the [documentation](https://iddn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), 
which includes four tutorials and the API reference.
The tutorials can also be found in the `docs/notebooks` folder.

For details about the code to run simulations and make figures in the paper,
check out the [repository here](https://github.com/cbil-vt/iddn_experiments).

## Tests

To run tests, go to the folder of DDN3 source code, then run `pytest`.
```bash
pytest tests
```
It will compare output of DDN with reference values. It tests iDDN with two acceleration strategies.
