# Getting started

1. Install [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) which manages the project dependencies, and get all dependencies needed to work on this project:
```sh
pip3 install poetry && poetry check && poetry install
```
2. Use `./check.sh` to check the syntax, reindent and code guidelines
3. Run tests with 
```sh
poetry run pytest
```
