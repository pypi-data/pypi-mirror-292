# Falconry Pygments Theme

This repository contains the following [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) styles:

* `falconry-light` – style for light background
* `falconry-dark` – style for dark background

These styles are primarily intended for
[Falconry](https://github.com/falconry/)'s own projects, but hey –
they are open source – reuse or mod if you wish.

## Accessibility

We are just trying to get something aesthetic out for now;
the future goal is to meet at least the
[WCAG 2.1 criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
for color contrast.

## Acknowledgements

The implementation and structure of Pygment styles were inspired by
[accessible-pygments](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments).
