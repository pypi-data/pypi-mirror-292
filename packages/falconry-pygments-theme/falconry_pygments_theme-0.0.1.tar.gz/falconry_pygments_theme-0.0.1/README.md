# Falconry Pygments Theme

This repository contains the following [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) styles:

* ~~falconry-light~~ – not implemented yet
* `falconry-dark` – style for dark background

These styles are primarily intended for
[Falconry](https://github.com/falconry/)'s own projects, but hey –
they are open source – reuse or mod if you wish.

## Acknowledgements

The implementation and structure of Pygment styles was inspired by
[`accessible-pygments`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments).
