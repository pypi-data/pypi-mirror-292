With the use of webhooks, Embed Generator allows you to customize the appearance of your messages and make them more engaging.\n\nTo get started, all you need is a webhook URL, which can be obtained from the 'Integrations' tab in your server's settings. If you encounter any issues while setting up a webhook, our bot can assist you in creating one.\n\nInstead of using webhooks you can also select a server and channel directly here on the website. The bot will automatically create a webhook for you and use it to send the message.",
