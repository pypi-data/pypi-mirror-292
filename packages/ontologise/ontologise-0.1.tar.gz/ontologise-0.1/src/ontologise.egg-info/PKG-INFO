# ontologize
Code to leverage insight from marked up historical sources


## Build package

`python3 -m build` - builds objects in `dist`

Note that this hasn't been pushed to PyPI or similar, stopped following the tutorial [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives).

Created a pypi account (lemhop), added api token to ~/.pypirc.
