A Python package for downloading images from Reddit posts and comments. This tool fetches images from a given Reddit post URL and stores them in a ZIP archive.

## Features

- Downloads images from Reddit comments.
- Handles images from both top-level comments and nested replies.
- Provides a progress spinner during the download process.
- Configurable via a `config.json` file.

## Installation

To install the package, clone the repository and use pip to install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamrishu11/Reddit-Image-Downloader.git
cd reddit-image-downloader
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install reddit-image-downloader
```

  "REDDIT_USER_AGENT": "your_user_agent"
}
```
Replace the placeholders with your Reddit API credentials.

## Usage

You can use the package either as a command-line tool or import it into your Python scripts.

### Command line tool

Run the following command to start downloading images from a Reddit post:

```bash
reddit_image_downloader --help
```

You will be prompted to enter the Reddit post URL. The images will be saved to images.zip.

### Python API

To use the functionality programmatically, import the module and call the download_images_from_post function:

```python
from reddit_image_downloader.main import download_images_from_post

# Example usage
post_url = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/example_post/'
output_zip = 'output_images.zip'
config = {
    'REDDIT_CLIENT_ID': 'your_client_id',
    'REDDIT_SECRET': 'your_client_secret',
    'REDDIT_USER_AGENT': 'your_user_agent'
}

download_images_from_post(post_url, output_zip, config)
```

## Testing

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This will run all test cases defined in the tests directory.
