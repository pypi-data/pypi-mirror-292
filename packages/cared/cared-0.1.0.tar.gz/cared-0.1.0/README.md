# CaReD PyPI package

CaReD stands for **Ca**talysis **Re**search **D**atamangement. It is a web-based system developed at LIKAT.
The corresponding Python packages are named `cared-FEATURE` (e.g. [cared-cli](https://pypi.org/project/cared-cli/) which defines a `cared` command). 

It is quite likely that some users try `pip install cared` although no CaReD-related package with this name exists.
So we created this repo and the PYPI package [cared](https://pypi.org/project/cared/) to reserve the name before someone with bad intentions does it.
