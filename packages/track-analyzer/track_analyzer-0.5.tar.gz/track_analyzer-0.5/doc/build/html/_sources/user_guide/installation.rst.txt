===========================
Track Analyzer installation
===========================

.. _installation:

- If you haven't installed Python yet, install Python 3.10: download miniconda 3.10: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- Open a Terminal (Mac & Linux) or open an Anaconda powershell (Windows)
- Create environment: run :code:`conda create -y -n TA_env -c conda-forge python=3.10`
- Activate environment (to be run every time you open a new terminal): run :code:`conda activate TA_env`

**Track Analyzer** depends on `napari <https://napari.org/>`_, whose installation can be tricky. For this reason, we recommend to install it independently using conda before installing **Track Analyzer** using pip. ::

    conda install -c conda-forge napari
    pip install track-analyzer


Archive overview
================

* **doc** => the documentation in html and pdf
* **example** => synthetic data examples are stored in the `example` folder. Each example contains a `params.csv` file containing for each track the "true" values.
* **track_analyzer** => the track analyzer python library
* **setup.py** => the installation script
* **requirements.txt** => the python dependencies
* **COPYING** => the licensing
