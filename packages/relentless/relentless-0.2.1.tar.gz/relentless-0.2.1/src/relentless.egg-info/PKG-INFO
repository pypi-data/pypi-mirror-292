## Overview

`relentless` is a Python package for executing molecular simulations in larger
computational workflows. The simulation protocol is specified as a reproducible,
human-readable recipe that is run natively in popular engines such as
[LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org) and
[HOOMD-blue](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io). `relentless` also has robust
features for optimization with simulations, including independent and dependent
variables with automatic differentiation, objective functions of simulations,
and optimization methods. All features are readily extensible through a clean
hierarchy of abstract objects, enabling you to quickly use your own simulation
code or optimization objective. Our initial goal was to enable optimization of
the `rel`ative `ent`ropy of structural coarse-graining and materials design:
with `less` code.
