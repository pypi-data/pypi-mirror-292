## Install local development version

To install the extension into localstack in developer mode, you will need Python 3.10, and create a virtual environment in the extensions project.

In the newly generated project, simply run

```bash
make install
```

Then, to enable the extension for LocalStack, run

```bash
localstack extensions dev enable .
