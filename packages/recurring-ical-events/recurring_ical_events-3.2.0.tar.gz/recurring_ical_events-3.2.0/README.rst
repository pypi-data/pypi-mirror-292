ICal has some complexity to it:
Events, TODOs and Journal entries can be repeated, removed from the feed and edited later on.
This tool takes care of these circumstances.

Let's put our expertise together and build a tool that can solve this!

Usage
-----

The `icalendar <https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/>`_ module is responsible for parsing and converting calendars.
The `recurring_ical_events <https://pypi.org/project/recurring-ical-events/>`_ module uses such a `calendar`_ and creates all repetitions of its events within a time span.

To import this module, write

.. code:: Python

    import recurring_ical_events

There are several methods you can use to unfold repeating events, such as ``at(a_time)`` and ``between(a_start, an_end)``.

``at(a_date)``
**************

You can get all events which take place at ``a_date``.
A date can be a year, e.g. ``2023``, a month of a year e.g. January in 2023 ``(2023, 1)``, a day of a certain month e.g. ``(2023, 1, 1)``, an hour e.g. ``(2023, 1, 1, 0)``, a minute e.g. ``(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0)``, or second as well as a `datetime.date <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date>`_ object and `datetime.datetime <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime>`_.

The start and end are inclusive. As an example: if an event is longer than one day it is still included if it takes place at ``a_date``.

.. code:: Python

    a_date =  2023   # a year
    a_date = (2023,) # a year
    a_date = (2023, 1) # January in 2023
    a_date = (2023, 1, 1) # the 1st of January in 2023
    a_date = "20230101"   # the 1st of January in 2023
    a_date = (2023, 1, 1, 0) # the first hour of the year 2023
    a_date = (2023, 1, 1, 0, 0) # the first minute in 2023
    a_date = datetime.date(2023) # the first day in 2023
    a_date = datetime.date(2023, 1, 1) # the first day in 2023
    a_date = datetime.datetime.now() # this exact second

    events = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).at(a_date)

The resulting ``events`` are a list of `icalendar events <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Event>`_, see below.

``between(start, end)``
***********************

``between(start, end)`` returns all events happening between a start and an end time. Both arguments can be `datetime.datetime`_, `datetime.date`_, tuples of numbers passed as arguments to `datetime.datetime`_ or strings in the form of
``%Y%m%d`` (``yyyymmdd``) and ``%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ`` (``yyyymmddThhmmssZ``).
Additionally, the ``end`` argument can be a ``datetime.timedelta`` to express that the end is relative to the ``start``.
For examples of arguments, see ``at(a_date)`` above.

.. code:: Python

    events = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).between(start, end)

The resulting ``events`` are in a list of `icalendar events`_, see below.

``after(earliest_end)``
***********************

You can retrieve events that happen after a time or date using ``after(earliest_end)``.
Events that are happening during the ``earliest_end`` are included in the iteration.

.. code:: Python

    earlierst_end = 2019
    for event in recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).after(earlierst_end):
        print(event["DTEND"]) # all dates printed are after January 1st 2019


``all()``
*********

If you wish to iterate over all occurrences of the components, then you can use ``all()``.
Since a calendar can define a huge amount of recurring entries, this method generates them
and forgets them, reducing memory overhead.

This example shows the first event that takes place in the calendar:

.. code:: Python

    query = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object)
    first_event = next(query.all()) # not all events are generated
    print("First event starts at: {first_event}")

``count()``
***********

You can count occurrences of events and other components using ``count()``.

.. code:: Python

    number_of_events = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).count()
    print(f"{number_of_events} events happen in this calendar.")

    number_of_TODOs = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object, components=["VTODO"]).count()
    print(f"You have {number_of_TODOs} things to do!")

    number_of_journal_entries = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object, components=["VJOURNAL"]).count()
    print(f"There are {number_of_journal_entries} journal entries in the calendar.")

``events`` as list - ``at()`` and ``between()``
***********************************************

The result of both ``between(start, end)`` and ``at(a_date)`` is a list of `icalendar events`_.
By default, all attributes of the event with repetitions are copied, like ``UID`` and ``SUMMARY``.
However, these attributes may differ from the source event:

* ``DTSTART`` which is the start of the event instance. (always present)
* ``DTEND`` which is the end of the event instance. (always present)
* ``RDATE``, ``EXDATE``, ``RRULE`` are the rules to create event repetitions.
  They are **not** included in repeated events, see `Issue 23 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/23>`_.
  To change this, use ``of(calendar, keep_recurrence_attributes=True)``.

Generator - ``after()`` and ``all()``
*************************************

If the resulting components are ordered when ``after(earliest_end)`` or ``all()`` is used.
The result is an iterator that returns the events in order.

.. code:: Python

    for event in recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).after(datetime.datetime.now()):
        print(event["DTSTART"]) # The start is ordered

Different Components, not just Events
*************************************

By default the ``recurring_ical_events`` only selects events as the name already implies.
However, there are different `components <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Component>`_ available in a `calendar <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Calendar>`_.
You can select which components you like to have returned by passing ``components`` to the ``of`` function:

.. code:: Python

    of(a_calendar, components=["VEVENT"])

Here is a template code for choosing the supported types of components:

.. code:: Python

   events = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar).between(...)
   journals = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=["VJOURNAL"]).between(...)
   todos = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=["VTODO"]).between(...)
   all = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=["VTODO", "VEVENT", "VJOURNAL"]).between(...)

If a type of component is not listed here, it can be added.
Please create an issue for this in the source code repository.

Speed
*****

If you use ``between()`` or ``at()``
several times, it is faster to re-use the object coming from ``of()``.

.. code:: Python

    rcalendar = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object)
    events_of_day_1 = rcalendar.at(day_1)
    events_of_day_2 = rcalendar.at(day_2)
    events_of_day_3 = rcalendar.at(day_3)
    # ...

Skip bad formatted ical events
******************************

Some events may be badly formatted and therefore cannot be handled by recurring-ical-events.
Passing ```skip_bad_series=True``` as ``of()`` argument will totally skip theses events.

.. code:: Python

    of(a_calendar, skip_bad_series=True)


Version Fixing
**************

If you use this library in your code, you may want to make sure that
updates can be received but they do not break your code.
The version numbers are handeled this way: ``a.b.c`` example: ``0.1.12``

- ``c`` is changed for each minor bug fix.
- ``b`` is changed whenever new features are added.
- ``a`` is changed when the interface or major assumptions change that may break your code.

So, I recommend to version-fix this library to stay with the same ``a``
while ``b`` and ``c`` can change.

Development
-----------

Code style
**********

Please install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ before git commit.  It will ensure that the code is formatted and linted as expected using `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_.

.. code-block:: shell

   pre-commit install


Testing
*******

This project's development is driven by tests.
Tests assure a consistent interface and less knowledge lost over time.
If you like to change the code, tests help that nothing breaks in the future.
They are required in that sense.
Example code and ics files can be transferred into tests and speed up fixing bugs.

You can view the tests in the `test folder
<https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/tree/master/test>`_.
If you have a calendar ICS file for which this library does not
generate the desired output, you can add it to the ``test/calendars``
folder and write tests for what you expect.
If you like, `open an issue <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues>`_ first, e.g. to discuss the changes and
how to go about it.


To run the tests, we use ``tox``.
``tox`` tests all different Python versions which we want to  be compatible to.

.. code-block:: shell

   pip3 install tox

To run all the tests:

.. code-block:: shell

   tox

To run the tests in a specific Python version:

.. code-block:: shell

   tox -e py39



New Releases
------------

To release new versions,

1. edit the Changelog Section
2. edit setup.py, the ``__version__`` variable
3. create a commit and push it
4. wait for `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/actions>`_ to finish the build
5. run

   .. code-block:: shell

       python3 setup.py tag_and_deploy

6. notify the issues about their release

Architecture
------------

.. image:: img/architecture.png
   :alt: Architecture Diagram showing the components interacting

Each icalendar **Calendar** can contain Events, Journal entries,
TODOs and others, called **Components**.
Those entries are grouped by their ``UID``.
Such a ``UID`` defines a **Series** of **Occurrences** that take place at
a given time.
Since each **Component** is different, the **ComponentAdapter** offers a unified
interface to interact with them.
The **Calendar** gets filtered and for each ``UID``,
a **Series** can use one or more **ComponentAdapters** to create 
**Occurrences** of what happens in a time span.
These **Occurrences** are used internally and convert to **Components** for further use.
