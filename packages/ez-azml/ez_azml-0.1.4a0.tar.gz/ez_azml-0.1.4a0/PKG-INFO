# Easy AzureML (Beta)

This project attempts to reduce the boilerplate code when launching simple azureml jobs from command line.

It aims to:

- Be object oriented to enable end users to extend the SDK for their custom workflows, trying to reuse AzureML SDK V2 native classes as much as possible
- Be config driven (thanks to [jsonargparse](https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fomni-us%2Fjsonargparse)) to improve reusability of objects and code
- Be, as it name states, easy to use (hence focused in simple usecases)
- Unify through wrappers the different flows and runs in Azure through a common interface

You can check more info at the [documentation site](https://ez-azml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Installation

Simply run 
```bash
pip install ez-azml
```
# Quickstart

You can run an example with (if you have cloned the repo)
## Command

ez-azml --config configs/command/main.yaml run
```
## PipelineRun
```
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. ez-azml --config configs/pipeline/main.yaml run
