## Installation

Install SimpleYNews using pip:

```bash
pip install simpleynews
```

## Quick Start

```python
from simpleynews import SimpleYNews

# Get news for a single ticker
aapl = SimpleYNews.Ticker("AAPL")
apple_news = aapl.news

# Print the results
print("News for AAPL:")
for item in apple_news:
    print(f"Title: {item['title']}")
    print(f"Link: {item['link']}")
    print(f"Publisher: {item['publisher']}")
    print(f"Publish Time: {item['providerPublishTime']}")
    print(f"Type: {item['type']}")
    print(f"Related Tickers: {item['relatedTickers']}")
    print("---")

# Get news for multiple tickers
tickers = ["GOOGL", "MSFT"]
for ticker in tickers:
    news = SimpleYNews.Ticker(ticker).news
    print(f"\nNews for {ticker}:")
    for item in news:
        print(f"Title: {item['title']}")
        print(f"Link: {item['link']}")
        print(f"Publisher: {item['publisher']}")
        print(f"Publish Time: {item['providerPublishTime']}")
        print("---")
```

## Features

- Scrape latest news for given stock tickers from Yahoo! Finance
- Simple and intuitive API similar to yfinance
- Caching of news data to reduce repeated requests
- Logging for better debugging and monitoring

## Data Structure

Each news item is a dictionary with the following keys:

- `uuid`: Unique identifier for the news item
- `title`: Title of the news article
- `link`: URL to the full article
- `publisher`: Name of the news publisher
- `providerPublishTime`: Timestamp of when the article was published
- `type`: Type of the news item (usually 'STORY')
- `relatedTickers`: List of stock tickers related to the news item
- `thumbnail`: Dictionary containing thumbnail information (if available)
- `summary`: Brief summary of the article (if available)

## Limitations

- SimpleYNews scrapes data from Yahoo! Finance's website, which may change without notice. This could break the functionality of the package.
- The package does not provide real-time data. There may be delays in when news is published and when it becomes available through this package.
- Due to the nature of web scraping, this package may be slower than official APIs.
