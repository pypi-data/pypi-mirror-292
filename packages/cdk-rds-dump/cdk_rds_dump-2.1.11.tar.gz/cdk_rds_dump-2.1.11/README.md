## Usage

Install from npm:

```sh
npm i cdk-rds-dump
```

Then write CDK code as below:

```python
import { RdsDump, DbEngine } from 'cdk-rds-dump';

declare const rdsCluster: rds.DatabaseCluster;
new RdsDump(this, "RdsDump", {
  dbEngine: DbEngine.MYSQL,
  rdsCluster: cluster,
  databaseName: "testDatabase",
  schedule: events.Schedule.cron({ minute: "0", hour: "0" }),
  lambdaEnv: {
    ENV_VAR: "value",
  },
  createSecretsManagerVPCEndpoint: true,
  createS3GatewayEndpoint: true,
  // DB secret is obtained from rdsCluster.secret as default.
  // If you want to use a different secret, you can specify it as follows.
  // secretId: 'secretsmanager-secret-id',
});
```

## How does it work?

This code creates a new RDS cluster and uses the RdsDump Construct to dump the data from that RDS cluster. The dumped data is generated as an SQL file and stored in Amazon S3.

For detailed usage and details of the parameters, refer to the [API documentation](./API.md).

## Why do we need this construct?

AWS RDS is a very useful managed RDB service and includes, by default, the ability to create snapshots.
However, in some cases, such as for development reasons, it is easier to handle SQL files dumped from the DB.
Therefore, cdk-rds-dump was created as a construct to easily create SQL files on a regular basis.
