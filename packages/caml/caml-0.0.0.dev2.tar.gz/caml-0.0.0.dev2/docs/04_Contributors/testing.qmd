## Unit Testing
Unit tests are under the `tests/echo/` directory following the same structure of the `echo/` prefixed by "test_". 
For example, if we wanted to write tests for `echo.py`, we would create a new file to build these tests
`tests/echo/test_echo.py`. 

To run unit tests, we have configured a Pixi job so you can run the command: 
```bash
pixi run --environment dev test
```

This will run your unit tests (with respective output printed in terminal) and update the coverage badge 
![](/assets/coverage.svg)

Additionally, an html report of the coverage will be exported to `tests/reports/htmlcov`, 
which can be a useful tool for interactively evaluating the coverage of your unit tests.

## Advanced Testing
Unit tests are automatically run during PR process via GitHub Actions.
