# API reference

This is the API reference for the echoSMs package.

Each type of model is contained in a separate Python class (with name ending in ``Model``), but with common calling signatures across all model classes, as defined in ``ScatterModelBase``. There are also classes to provide ready access to the benchmark models and reference model definitions. There are also utility functions.

## ScatterModelBase

::: echosms.ScatterModelBase

## DCMModel

::: echosms.DCMModel

## DWBA models

There are several models that use the distorted wave Born approximation, documented below:

### DWBA

This is a placeholder for the distorted wave Born approximation model.

### PT-DWBA

::: echosms.PTDWBAModel
    options:
        heading_level: 4

### SDWBA

This is a placeholder for the stochastic distorted wave Born approximation model.

## ESModel

::: echosms.ESModel

## MSSModel

::: echosms.MSSModel

## PSMSModel

::: echosms.PSMSModel

## ReferenceModels

Reference models are the models and parameters defined in the Jech et al, 2015 paper. The parameters are stored in a TOML-formatted file in the echoSMs repository and the ``ReferenceModels`` class provides easy access to the data in that file.

Additional reference models may be defined in the future and can be added to the TOML file.
