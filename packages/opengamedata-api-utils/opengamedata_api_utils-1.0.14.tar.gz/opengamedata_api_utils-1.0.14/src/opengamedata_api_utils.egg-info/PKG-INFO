# opengamedata-server

Repository for server-side scripts in opengamedata. In particular, this is where we have code for the OGD APIs.

## Getting Started

### Hello World of Flask

Steps to run:
1. Check out latest `opengamedata-server`.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure you've got flask.
3. Run `flask run`.
4. Open localhost:5000 or localhost:5000/hello to see some really basic text output from the Flask server.

If Flask doesn't run, it's possible you'd need to first export FLASK_APP as an environment variable, set to "wsgi" (so in Bash, export FLASK_APP=wsgi).
However, the script is named wsgi.py specifically because Flask is supposed to auto-detect it. So if this issue ever did come up, please ping Luke so he can look into it.

## APIs

Below is a listing of the current API calls available, in function format to indicate what the request parameters.
For each API, there is also an api path, with path parameters in angle bracket (<, >) format.
Lastly, at this point in time, the `<server_path>` is `https://fieldday-web.wcer.wisc.edu/opengamedata.wsgi`

### Classroom API

#### Verify the API is alive

`<server_path>/hello`  
`GET()`

### Player API
