"""
Many algorithms use generators that are seeded by previous candidates, e.g. in 
Basin-Hopping the next candidate is generated by a small random perturbation of
the previous candidate.

Samplers are responsible for keeping track of which candidates to use as seeds
for the next generation of candidates.
