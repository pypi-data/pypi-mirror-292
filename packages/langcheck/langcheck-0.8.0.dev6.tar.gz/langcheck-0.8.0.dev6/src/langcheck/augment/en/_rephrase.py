    '''Rephrases each string in instances (usually a list of prompts) without
    changing their meaning. We use a modified version of the prompt presented
    in `"Rethinking Benchmark and Contamination for Language Models with
    Rephrased Samples" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04850>`__ to make an LLM
    rephrase the given text.

    We currently support two model types:

    1. The 'openai' type, where we use OpenAI's 'gpt-turbo-3.5' model
    by default.

    2. The 'azure_openai' type. Essentially the same as the 'openai' type,
    except that it uses the AzureOpenAI client. Note that you must specify the
    model to use in ``openai_args``, e.g.
    ``openai_args={'model': 'YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME'}``

    Args:
        instances: A single string or a list of strings to be augmented.
        num_perturbations: The number of perturbed instances to generate for
            each string in instances
        model_type: The type of model to use ('openai' or 'azure_openai'),
            default 'openai'
        openai_client: OpenAI or AzureOpenAI client, default None. If this is
            None, we will attempt to create a default client.
        openai_args: Dict of additional args to pass in to the
            ``client.chat.completions.create`` function, default None

    Returns:
        A list of rephrased instances.
