`ViSL3D` is a Python package that creates X3D and HTML files to visualize datacubes from astrophysics in 3D in an interactive way. We use [X3D](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) and [x3dom](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) to represent figures in 3D and to integrate them into an HTML. The models have been made taking the x3d-pathway (Vogt et al. 2016) as a starting point. The current code was made for radio data, although it can be used with other types of 3D data.

## Installation

```pip install visl3d```

## How to use

Examples of how to use the package are provided in the Jupyter notebook [jupyter_example.ipynb](https://github.com/ixakalabadie/cube_x3d/blob/master/example/jupyter_example.ipynb).

The produced HTML file can be visualised in any standard browser.

## Prerequisites to visualise external X3D file (createX3D/createHTML)

1. Install a local HTTP Server. Visualisations produced by **ViSL3D** must be opened through a local server in order to be displayed. There are a few options:
    - [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) is a popular HTTP server that can be installed in most operating systems.
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) has a built-in HTTP server that can be used by running `python -m http.server` in the directory where the HTML and X3D files are located.
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has a built-in HTTP server that can be used by installing the [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension.

2. Copy the [x3dom](https://github.com/ixakalabadie/ViSL3D/tree/master/x3dom) folder into the server root directory. This should be the directory where the HTML and X3D files are located. By default, in Apache, it is `/var/www/html` in Linux, `C:\Apache24\htdocs` in Windows and `/usr/local/var/www` (or similar) in Mac. The DocumentRoot can be found and modified in the `httpd.config` file.

3. Move the created X3D and HTML files into the Apache DocumentRoot directory and open the visualisation in a browser (most common browsers are supported) by typing the URL `localhost\example_file.html`.
