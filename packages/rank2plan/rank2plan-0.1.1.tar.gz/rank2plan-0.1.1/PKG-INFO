# rank2plan

Implementation of constraint generation and column generation (soon) for solving
large L1-RankSVMs with hinge loss (with pair-specific gaps) and sample weights.
This is based on the work by Dedieu et al (2022) on solving large L1-SVMs with
hinge loss. See `documents/theory.pdf` for how we extend their work. The "2plan"
part of the package name comes from the tool being used to learn heuristics for planning.

## Installation

Install with

```bash
pip install rank2plan
```

The PyPI release only supports `3.8 <= python <= 3.10` for now.
