# icepak-network-deps

### Purpose

The PyAEDT Network Editor has multiple open-source package dependencies. The Python package icepak-network-deps serves to encapsulate those imports to simplify installation workflows and create clear separation between open and closed source Ansys Icepak development

### What is the PyAEDT Network Editor? 

The PyAEDT Network Editor is a graph manipulation software intended to simplify thermal network visualization, manipulation, and workflow. The Editor enables a user-friendly browser-based UI to edit and organize graphical data in the Ansys AEDT software.  

### Dependencies
The PyAEDT Network Editor is reliant on the following dependencies: 

dependencies = [
  "pyaedt",
  "networkx",
  "dash",
  "dash-cytoscape",
  "dash-bootstrap-components", 
  "pandas", 
  "dash_daq",
