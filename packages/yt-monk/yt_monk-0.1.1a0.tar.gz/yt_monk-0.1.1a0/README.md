## Important

This is my first project uploaded to Github. If you find a mistake or just anything you don't like, just let me know and I'll try to fix it.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This little project began when I wanted to download a playlist from YouTube. For downloading single videos, I always use [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools), because it is ad-free and open-source, but it is still missing something... a playlist downloader. I tried a few other YT downloaders to download a playlist, but I wasn't happy with their functionality. 

<img src="images/cobalt.png" width=100% height=auto style="max-width: 800px">

([cobalt](https://cobalt.tools) website)

So I decided to make my own YT video and playlist downloader in Python.

### Making the program
First, I downloaded a [testing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0) and captured the network traffic from [cobalt](https://cobalt.tools), because I wanted to know how do they download videos:

<img src="images/network.png" width=auto height=100% style="max-height: 200px">

<img src="images/request.png" width=auto height=100% style="max-height: 250px">

(the network traffic capture)

Based on that capture, I found out, that the user recieves the video as a stream of data from `olly.imput.net/api`. Now I need to know how to make the request to their API to get the stream URL, so I looked into the JavaScript code, that was downloading the videos:

<img src="images/code1.png" width=100% height=auto style="max-width: 700px">

<img src="images/code2.png" width=100% height=auto style="max-width: 450px">

(some of the JavaScript code of the website)

Now that I know how to get the stream URL, I can recreate it in python:
```python
response = json.loads(requests.post(self.api_url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data)).text)
if response['status'] == 'stream':
  stream_url = response['url']
```
And capture the stream to a file:

```python
def captureStream(self, stream_url, file_path):
  with requests.get(stream_url, stream=True) as r:
    r.raise_for_status()
      with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
        for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
          f.write(chunk)
```


Then I just made some more functions.



### To-do 
- [ ] Make a python package work
- [ ] Upload the package to PyPi
- [ ] Make a cli app
- [ ] Make a js chrome extension 
- [ ] Make an exe app
- [x] Reorganize files






<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Now you have 3 options: download it as an exe file and run it on Windows without the need to install Python or you can download the Python file and run that or you can install it as a python library and use it in your code.

### Getting the Windows executable

1. Download [`yt_monk.exe`](https://github.com/vojtikDortik/yt-monk/blob/master/yt_monk.exe)
2. Run it on Windows
3. Windows might mark it as a , so just click on `More info` and then click on `Run anyway` (I could try to fix that, but it is not my main goal now and also idk how to fix it)

    If you realy don't trust it (I get it), you can download the python code.

### Getting the Python file

1. Download [`yt_monk.py`](https://github.com/vojtikDortik/yt-monk/blob/master/yt_monk/yt_monk.py) and [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/vojtikDortik/yt-monk/blob/master/requirements.txt)

2. Install [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/vojtikDortik/yt-monk/blob/master/requirements.txt) using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run it using python:

    ```python
    python yt_monk.py
    ```






### Getting the library

I am stil working on getting it uploaded to PyPi. That is it for now.









<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Here are some basic examples of using my code

### Using as an application
When you run [`yt_monk.py`](https://github.com/vojtikDortik/yt-monk/blob/master/yt_monk/yt_monk.py) or [`yt_monk.exe`](https://github.com/vojtikDortik/yt-monk/blob/master/yt_monk.exe) you will get prompted to enter the URL

<img src="images/cmd_usage.png" width=100% height=auto style="max-width: 800px">

You can enter video or playlist URL (the program will detect the URL type) or `q` to quit the loop.




### Using as a Python library

Import the library and define the `downloader` object:
```python
import yt_monk

downloader = yt_monk.YT_Downloader()
```

Downloading a video:


```python
video_url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0' 

downloader.downloadVideo(video_url)
```

Downloading a playlist:

```python
playlist_url = 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi' 

downloader.downloadPlaylist(playlist_url)
```
