    "# Post-processing and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have run many HAWC2 simulations, perhaps on a cluster or using a batch script, it is useful to visualize the statistics. The two steps are to first post-process and then visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Post-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the files have been generated, you can use the lacbox to calculate statistics from all of the simulations and save the results into an HDF5 file. The post-processing can be with or without the 10-minute damage-equivalent loads (DELs). Calculating without includes base statistics such as mean, standard deviation, max, min, etc. For more documentation on the post-processing options, please see the API tab to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because post-processing is a heavy computational load, we will not demo it in detail in this notebook. However, here is some code to show you what it would look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "res_dir = './res/'  # folder with HDF5 HAWC2 files\n",
    "save_path = 'stats.hdf5'  # where to save the stats file\n",
    "calc_del = True  # don't calculate damage-equivalent loads\n",
    "stats_df = process_statistics(res_dir, save_path, calc_del=calc_del)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is some code demonstrating how you can use pandas to visualize the results in the HDF5 file.\n",
    "\n",
