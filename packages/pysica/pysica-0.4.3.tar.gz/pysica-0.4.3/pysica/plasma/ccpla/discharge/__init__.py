	Tools for the simulation of plasma discharges: definition of particles ensambles and simulation of particle motion

        The modules in this subpackage define classes to store data about electrons, ions and neutrals.
        They also provide functions which call fortran functions compiled into the fortran package 
        to simulate the motion and interaction of these particles inside plasma discharges

        Subpackages
        -----------

        *fortran*
            functions compiled from Fortran to simulate the motion of particles in a CCP discharge
 
       	Modules
        -------

	*reactors*
 	    defines characteristics of plasma reactors, such as electrodes dimensions, bias, etc...
        *moving_particles*
            defines the ensables of electrons and ions
	*target_particles*
            defines neutral particles and their cross sections for impact with electrons and ions
        *particles_data_manager*
            read properties of neutral particles from a ascii file
        *particle_mover*
            provides functions to simulate the particles motion and interaction in a cold plasma
            it uses the modules contained in the fortran subpackage
