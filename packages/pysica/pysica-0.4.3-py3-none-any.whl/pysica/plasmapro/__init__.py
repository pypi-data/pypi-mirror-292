    Tools for the simulation of plasma discharges.

    This package contains some modules and subpackages which may be useful for the simulation of plasma discharges.

    * scripts
        - ccpla         -> script designed to simulate the motion of charged particles (electrons and ions) in 
                           a capacitivley coupled plasma discharge
        - ccpla_analysis-> analysis of output from ccpla script 
                           (ccpla must have been run with the option -s to save simulation results on ascii files)

    * modules
        - ccpla_defaults-> some constants used in the package
        - ccpla_init    -> intialization functions
        - ccpla_print   -> functions used to print simulation info in text windows
        - ccpla_gui     -> functions and classes used to run the simulaion within a GUI

    * sub-packages
        - fortran       -> modules compiled from Fortran using f2py: they provide functions to 
                           simulate the motion of electrons and ions in cold plasmas using leap-frog and PIC.
                           Functions in this package are called by the modules contained in the "discharge" subpackage;
                           normally it is not required to access them directly
        - discharge     -> modules used to define particles ensambles (charged and neutrals), reactors properties
                           and to simulate the charged particles motion
        - plot          -> modules used to plot simulation data


    Documentation is also available in the docstrings.
