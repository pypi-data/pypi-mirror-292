# Toolbox-for-Adaptive-Fourier-Decomposition

This toolbox is intended to help users use the adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) **easily**. 

This toolbox contains **multiple implementations** of the AFD for different types of processed signals and different decomposition process.

This is the Python version. There is a [*online version*](https://afd.must.edu.mo/) based on Python version v2.0. You can try the AFD quickly.

You can find the matlab version in [another repository](https://github.com/pikipity/Toolbox-for-Adaptive-Fourier-Decomposition-MATLAB) or [MathWork file exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62783-toolbox-for-adaptive-fourier-decomposition)

Please check the [**document**](https://toolbox-for-adaptive-fourier-decomposition.readthedocs.io/) for detailed information. 

## Advantages of AFD

+ Adaptive decomposition:
  + Adaptive basis;
  + Orthogonal decomposition components;
  + Decomposition components are  mono-components that only contain non-negative analytic phase derivatives;
  + Fast energy convergence;
  + Rigorous mathematical foundation.
+ Provide the transient time-frequency distribution:
  + Correct total energy;
  + Non-negative real-valuedness;
  + Weak and strong finite suports.

## AFD methods included in the toolbox

+ Core AFD:
  + Single channel
    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)
  + Multi-channel
    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)
+ Unwinding AFD:
  + Single channel 
    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)
  + Multi-channel
    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)
