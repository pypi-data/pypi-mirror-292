# STCC
STCC is a novel **consensus clustering framework** designed for **spatial transcriptomics data**, which enhances spatial domain detection by integrating outcomes from various state-of-the-art tools using consensus strategies such as **Average-based**, **Onehot-based**,**Hypergraph-based**, and **wNMF-based** methods. 

The algorithms implemented by STCC are:

* **Average-based**
* **Onehot-based**
* **wNMF-based**
