# *stamina*: Production-grade Retries Made Easy

Transient failures are common in distributed systems.
To make your systems resilient, you need to **retry** failed operations.
But bad retries can make things *much worse*.

*stamina* is an opinionated wrapper around the great-but-unopinionated [Tenacity](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/) package.
Our goal is to be as **ergonomic** as possible, while doing the **right thing by default**, and minimizing the potential for **misuse**.
It is the result of years of copy-pasting the same configuration over and over again:

- Retry only on certain exceptions – or even a subset of them by introspecting them first using a predicate.
- Exponential **backoff** with **jitter** between retries.
- Limit the number of retries **and** total time.
- Automatic **async** support – including [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/).
- Preserve **type hints** of the decorated callable.
- Flexible **instrumentation** with [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python), [*structlog*](https://www.structlog.org/), and standard library's `logging` support out-of-the-box.
- Dedicated support for **testing** that allows to _globally_ deactivate retries, or to limit the number of retries and to remove backoffs.

For example:

```python
import httpx

import stamina


@stamina.retry(on=httpx.HTTPError, attempts=3)
def do_it(code: int) -> httpx.Response:
    resp = httpx.get(f"https://httpbin.org/status/{code}")
    resp.raise_for_status()

    return resp
```

<!-- end docs index -->

**Async** callables work use the same API and it's possible to retry **arbitrary blocks**, too.
Check out our [tutorial](https://stamina.hynek.me/en/latest/tutorial.html) for more examples!



## Release Information

### Added

- The *on* argument in all retry functions now can be a callable that takes an exception and returns a bool which decides whether or not a retry should be scheduled.
  [#70](https://github.com/hynek/stamina/pull/70)

- `stamina.Attempt` now has a `next_wait` attribute that contains the time the *next* backoff will wait, if the *current* attempt fails (sans jitter).
  [#72](https://github.com/hynek/stamina/pull/72)

- It is now possible to switch *stamina* into a testing mode using `stamina.set_testing()`.
  It disables backoffs and caps the number of retries.
  [#73](https://github.com/hynek/stamina/pull/73)
