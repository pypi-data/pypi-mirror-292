# `pylogfunctionusage`

## Project Description

**LogFunctionUsage** is a Python decorator designed to enhance the logging capabilities of your programs functions by wrapping functions in a `try:` block. It logs function usage, including calls, exceptions, and results, to an SQLite table, making it easier to monitor and debug your code.

## Purpose

This module was originally written to monitor complex calculations during a master's thesis project. The need for precise and efficient logging arose, leading to the development of a solution that integrates seamlessly with SQLite databases. This enables comprehensive monitoring and debugging without significant performance overhead.

## Features

- **Database Configuration**: Customize the SQLite database name used for logging.
- **Table Name Customization**: Specify the table name for storing logs.
- **Error Handling**: Choose whether the program continues or stops on an error.
- **Log Table Refresh**: Option to clear the log table with each program run.
- **Error Printing**: Configure whether errors are printed to the console.
- **Result Logging**: Optionally log the results of functions.
- **Robustness**: Choose between committing logs immediately or at the end of the program.
- **Live Monitoring**: Enable live monitoring of program execution.
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Significant speedup for massive function calls, but use with caution.

## Performance

**LogFunctionUsage** is optimized for speed by using pure SQL expressions, which contrasts with tools based on ORM systems like SQLAlchemy. This approach ensures faster logging. On laptop with simple functions:

- Adds approximately 0.7ms (0.0007s) to function run time in WAL mode.
- Adds approximately 3ms (0.003s) to function run time in normal mode.

### Limitations 
As this module relies on sqlite db it doesn't support async code.

## Difference Over the `logging` Module

While the Python `logging` module is versatile and powerful, **LogFunctionUsage** offers specific advantages for function-level logging:

- **Granular Control**: Logs detailed function execution data, including arguments, keyword arguments, results, and exceptions.
- **SQL Storage**: Logs are stored in an SQLite table, making them easily accessible for querying and integration with other tools.
- **Performance**: Faster logging performance due to direct SQL expressions.

## Integration with Visualization Tools

The sql table with logs can be plugged into any visualization or reporting tool, such as:

- **Dash**
- **PowerBI**
- **Tableau**


This flexibility allows for advanced analysis, monitoring and visualization of function execution data.

## Simplicity

Using this module is incredibly simple. All you need is to decorate your functions, and the logging is taken care of. No complex setup or extensive configuration is required.


## Installation

you can clone the repository and install it from source:

```bash
pip install pylogfunctionusage
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ambroise-D/pylogfunctionusage.git
cd pylogfunctionusage
python setup.py install
```

or copy file pylogfunctionusage.py to your project and simply use it!

## Dependencies
**LogFunctionUsage** does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library. It uses built-in modules such as sqlite3, ensuring that you can use it without needing to install external dependencies.

## Usage
### Basic Usage
Create an instance of LogFunctionUsage and use it across your code:

```python
from pylogfunctionusage import LogFunctionUsage

log = LogFunctionUsage()

OR

log = LogFunctionUsage(db_name='your_database_name.db',
                       table_name='function_logs',
                       if_raise=False,
                       print_error=True,
                       refresh_log_table=True,
                       log_results=False,
                       robust=True,
                       live_monitor=False,
                       wal=False)


@log
def func_to_log(x, y="y"):
    return "some results"
```
### Error Handling Example
```python
@LogFunctionUsage(if_raise=True)
def function_to_log():
    print(1/0)  # This will throw an error due to 'if_raise = True'
```

## SQL Logging
Logs are saved to an SQLite table with the following columns: 
- **function_name:** Name of the function.
- **type:** Type of call (Start, End, or Except).
- **code_line:** Line of code that called the function.
- **timestamp:** Time of function call.
- **args:** Argument names passed to the function.
- **kwargs:** Keyword arguments passed to the function.
- **result:** Results and exceptions of the function.

#### Example log looks like:

| id  |      function_name      | type  | code_line |      timestamp      |      args       |    kwargs    |      result      |
|:---:|:-----------------------:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|
|  1  |       func_to_log       | START |    42     | 2024-04-20 16:20:00 | "('some_str',)" | "{'y': 'y'}" |       None       | 
|  2  |       func_to_log       |  END  |    42     | 2024-04-20 16:20:42 | "('some_str',)" | "{'y': 'y'}" |  'some results'  |
