This is SUPER in development and SUBJECT TO CHANGE
--------------------------------------------------

Yes, there is no documentation at the moment, its not really intended as usable to the outside world atm, I personally need a convenient pip install.

Model training framework bundled with performance evaluation and comparison tools for rapid prototyping. Go deep into setting up automatic configuration for ablations or quickly throw in a dataloader, model and loss function and run distributed training in seconds.

The aims of this project are
 - Empower you to only need to touch a few parts of the framework to get some wacky non-standard training loop done.
 - Easily roll in existing code bases into this framework so you can git clone yolo-69, register it to konductor, throw in your data and start training instead of whatever random framework of their codebase.
