# copyclipboard

`copyclipboard` is a command-line tool that allows you to copy the structure of a folder and the contents of specific file types to your clipboard. This can be especially useful when working with repositories and sharing the structure and code with others.

## Installation

To install `copyclipboard`, simply run:

```bash
pip install copyclipboard
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the copyclipboard command in your terminal.

### Copy All File Types
By default, the tool will copy the structure and contents of all files in your repository:

```bash
copyclipboard
```

### Copy Specific File Types
You can specify the file types you want to copy using the --extensions option:

```bash
copyclipboard --extensions .py .yaml
```

This will also update your configuration file in ~/.copyclipboard_config with the specified extensions.

### Manual Configuration
