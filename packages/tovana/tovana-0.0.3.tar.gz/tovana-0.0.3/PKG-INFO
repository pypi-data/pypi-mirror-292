## Why Tovana?
Current AI memory systems face significant drawbacks that limit their ability to mimic human-like intelligence. These include their static nature (vector dbs / semantic search), lack of contextual understanding, inability to learn from experience or form beliefs, poor handling of contradictions, limited associative capabilities, and absence of emotional intelligence. Additionally, AI agents struggle with abstraction, lack meta-cognitive abilities, and don't have mechanisms for selectively retaining or forgetting information. These shortcomings collectively restrict AI agents' adaptability, decision-making, and ability to navigate complex, real-world scenarios effectively.

The proposed AI agent memory system is designed to augment human memory and enhance AI agents' capabilities. Its purpose is to create more personalized, adaptive, and context-aware AI interactions by simulating human-like memory processes. This system aims to bridge the gap between static knowledge bases and dynamic, experience-based learning, allowing AI agents to evolve their understanding and behavior over time.

The system is a comprehensive memory and belief management framework for AI agents. It includes components for processing events, storing short-term and long-term memories, managing beliefs, creating associations, and informing decision-making processes. **The core concept revolves around converting experiences (events) into memories, which in turn shape beliefs.** These beliefs then influence the agent's reasoning, responses, and actions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install Tovana:
```bash
pip install tovana
```

2. Use it in your project:

```python
from tovana import MemoryManager

business_description = "an AI therapist"
message = "I just moved from New York to Paris for work."
user_id = "user123"

# Initialize with your preferred LLM provider and API key (Refer to the documentation for specific models)
memory_manager = MemoryManager(api_key="your-llm-provider-api-key-here", provider="anthropic",
                               business_description=business_description, include_beliefs=True)

# Update user memory
memory_manager.update_user_memory(user_id=user_id, message=message)

# Get user memory
user_memory = memory_manager.get_user_memory(user_id=user_id)
print(user_memory)  # Output: {'location': 'Paris', 'previous_location': 'New York'}

# Get memory context for LLM
context = memory_manager.get_memory_context(user_id=user_id)
print(context)  # Output: 'User Memory:\n location: Paris,\n previous_location: New York'

# Get beliefs
beliefs = memory_manager.get_beliefs(user_id=user_id)
print(beliefs)  # Output: {"beliefs": "- Suggest spending time with Charlie and Luna when user is feeling down\n- Suggest family activities with Lisa and Mai for emotional well-being\n- Recommend playing basketball for physical exercise and stress relief"}
```

## 🧠 Belief Generation: The Secret Sauce

Tovana introduces a new approach to LLM reasoning: actionable beliefs generated from user memory. These beliefs provide personalized insights that can significantly enhance your agent's planning, reasoning and responses.

### Examples
#### Input:
- `business_description`: "a commerce site"
- `memory`: {'pets': ['dog named charlie', 'horse named luna']}
#### Output:

```json
{"beliefs": ",- suggest pet products for dogs and horses"}
```

#### Input:

- `business_description`: "an AI therapist"
- `memory`: {'pets': ['dog named charlie', 'horse named luna', 'sleep_time: 10pm']}
#### Output:

```json
{"beliefs": ",- Suggest mediation at 9:30pm\n- Suggest spending time with Charlie and Luna for emotional well-being"}
```

## 🛠️ API Reference

### MemoryManager

- `get_memory(user_id: str) -> JSON`: Fetch user memory
- `delete_memory(user_id: str) -> bool`: Delete user memory
- `update_memory(user_id: str, message: str) -> JSON`: Update memory with relevant information if found in message
- `batch_update_memory(user_id: str, messages: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> JSON`: Update memory with relevant information if found in message
- `get_memory_context(user_id: str, message: Optiona[str]) -> str`: Get formatted memory context, general or message specific
- `get_beliefs(user_id: str) -> str`: Get actionable beliefs context

### Batch Update Memory
Traditional per-message memory updates can be costly and inefficient, especially in longer conversations. They often miss crucial context, leading to suboptimal information retrieval. 

Our batch memory update method addresses these challenges by processing entire conversations at once. This approach not only improves performance and reduces costs but also enhances the quality of extracted information. This results in a more coherent and accurate user memory, ultimately leading to better AI reasoning.

#### Example

```python
user_id = "user123"
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm planning a trip to Japan."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's exciting! When are you planning to go?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm thinking about next spring. I love sushi and technology."}
]

await memory_manager.batch_update_memory(user_id, messages)
```

### Sync vs Async Updates
Tovana provides both synchronous and asynchronous update methods to cater to different use cases and application architectures:

1. **Asynchronous Updates (`AsyncMemoryManager`)**: Ideal for applications built on asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI or asynchronous Python scripts. This allows for non-blocking memory updates, improving overall application performance, especially when dealing with I/O-bound operations or high-concurrency scenarios.
2. **Synchronous Updates (`MemoryManager`)**: Suitable for traditional synchronous applications or when you need to ensure that memory updates are completed before proceeding with other operations. This can be useful in scripts or applications where the order of operations is critical.

By providing both options, our library offers flexibility, allowing to choose the most appropriate method based on your specific application requirements and architecture.
