# qubit-discovery

qubit-discovery is an open-source Python library for optimizing superconducting circuits, built on top of [SQcircuit](https://sqcircuit.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). It provides:
* Composable loss functions with a special focus on qubit design, and straightforward methods to add new custom ones.
* Fine-tuned BFGS and SGD algorithms to optimize circuits, along with an interface to use other PyTorch optimizers. 
* Utility features including random circuit sampling and functions to automatically choose circuit truncation numbers.

With these capabilities, you can easily optimize any superconducting circuit for decoherence time, anharmonicity, charge sensitivity, or other desired targets. 

A description of the theory involved and example application is provided in the following paper:
