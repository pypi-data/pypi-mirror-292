Welcome to Schemathesis!
========================

Schemathesis is a tool that levels-up your API testing by leveraging API specs as a blueprints for generating test cases.
It focuses on testing for general properties â€” such as ensuring no input leads to server errors and all responses adhere to the API spec â€” rather than just checking specific input-output combinations.

This approach broadens your testing suite's capability to detect a wide range of potential issues, from trivial bugs to critical vulnerabilities.

With Schemathesis, you can:

ðŸŽ¯ **Catch Hard-to-Find Bugs**

- Uncover hidden crashes and edge cases that manual testing might miss
- Identify spec violations and ensure your API adheres to its defined contract

âš¡ **Accelerate Testing Cycles**

- Automatically generate a wide range of test cases based on your API schema
- Save time and effort by eliminating the need for manual test case creation

ðŸ§© **Integrate Seamlessly**

- Works with popular API formats such as OpenAPI, GraphQL.
- Easily integrate into your existing testing pipeline and CI/CD workflows

ðŸ”§ **Customize and Extend**

- Tune the testing process to your specific requirements using Python extensions
- Modify and enhance various aspects of the testing flow to suit your needs with rich configuration options

ðŸ“Š **Gain Valuable Insights**

- Get detailed reports and actionable insights to help you identify and fix issues quickly
- Reproduce failing test cases effortlessly with generated code samples and cURL commands

How it works?
-------------

Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of how Schemathesis works:

1. **Test Generation**: Using the API schema to create a test generator that you can fine-tune to your testing requirements.
2. **Execution and Adaptation**: Sending tests to the API and adapting through statistical models and heuristics to optimize subsequent cases based on responses.
3. **Analysis and Minimization**: Checking responses to identify issues. Minimizing means simplifying failing test cases for easier debugging.
4. **Stateful Testing**: Running multistep tests to assess API operations in both isolated and integrated scenarios.
5. **Reporting**: Generating detailed reports with insights and cURL commands for easy issue reproduction.

Research Findings on Open-Source API Testing Tools
--------------------------------------------------

Our study, presented at the **44th International Conference on Software Engineering**, highlighted Schemathesis's performance:

- **Defect Detection**: identified a total of **755 bugs** in **16 services**, finding between **1.4Ã— to 4.5Ã— more defects** than the second-best tool in each case.
- **High Reliability**: consistently operates seamlessly on any project, ensuring unwavering stability and reliability.
