## Schemathesis

Schemathesis is a tool that levels up your API testing by automating the process of finding crashes, uncovering bugs, and validating spec compliance. With Schemathesis, you can:

🎯 **Catch Hard-to-Find Bugs**

- Uncover hidden crashes and edge cases that manual testing might miss
- Identify spec violations and ensure your API adheres to its defined contract

⚡ **Accelerate Testing Cycles**

- Automatically generate a wide range of test cases based on your API schema
- Save time and effort by eliminating the need for manual test case creation

🧩 **Integrate Seamlessly**

- Works with popular API formats such as OpenAPI, GraphQL.
- Easily integrate into your existing testing pipeline and CI/CD workflows

🔧 **Customize and Extend**

- Tune the testing process to your specific requirements using Python extensions
- Modify and enhance various aspects of the testing flow to suit your needs with rich configuration options

📊 **Gain Valuable Insights**

- Get detailed reports and actionable insights to help you identify and fix issues quickly
- Reproduce failing test cases effortlessly with generated code samples and cURL commands

## Getting Started

Choose from multiple ways to start testing your API with Schemathesis.

> 💡 Your API schema can be either a URL or a local path to a JSON/YAML file.

### 💻 Command-Line Interface

Quick and easy for those who prefer the command line.

**Python**

1. Install via pip: `python -m pip install schemathesis`
2. Run tests

```bash
st run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json
```

**Docker**

1. Pull Docker image: `docker pull schemathesis/schemathesis:stable`
2. Run tests

```bash
docker run schemathesis/schemathesis:stable
   run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json
```

### 🐍 Python Library

For more control and customization, integrate Schemathesis into your Python codebase.

1. Install via pip: `python -m pip install schemathesis`
2. Add to your tests:

```python
import schemathesis

schema = schemathesis.from_uri("https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json")


@schema.parametrize()
def test_api(case):
    case.call_and_validate()
```

> 💡 See a complete working example project in the [/example](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/tree/master/example) directory.

### :octocat: GitHub Integration

**GitHub Actions**

Run Schemathesis tests as a part of your CI/CD pipeline.

Add this YAML configuration to your GitHub Actions:

```yaml
api-tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
  steps:
    - uses: schemathesis/action@v1
      with:
        schema: "https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json"
        # OPTIONAL. Add Schemathesis.io token for pull request reports
        token: ${{ secrets.SCHEMATHESIS_TOKEN }}
```

For more details, check out our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/schemathesis/action) repository.

> 💡 See our [GitHub Tutorial](https://docs.schemathesis.io/tutorials/github) for a step-by-step guidance.

**GitHub App**

Receive automatic comments in your pull requests and updates on GitHub checks status. Requires usage of our SaaS platform.

1. Install the [GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/schemathesis).
2. Enable in your repository settings.

### Software as a Service

Schemathesis CLI integrates with Schemathesis.io to enhance bug detection by optimizing test case generation for efficiency and realism. It leverages various techniques to infer appropriate data generation strategies, provide support for uncommon media types, and adjust schemas for faster data generation. The integration also detects the web server being used to generate more targeted test data. 

Schemathesis.io offers a user-friendly UI that simplifies viewing and analyzing test results. If you prefer an all-in-one solution with quick setup, we have a [free tier](https://schemathesis.io/#pricing) available.

## How it works

Here’s a simplified overview of how Schemathesis operates:

1. **Test Generation**: Using the API schema to create a test generator that you can fine-tune to your testing requirements.
2. **Execution and Adaptation**: Sending tests to the API and adapting through statistical models and heuristics to optimize subsequent cases based on responses.
3. **Analysis and Minimization**: Checking responses to identify issues. Minimizing means simplifying failing test cases for easier debugging.
4. **Stateful Testing**: Running multistep tests to assess API operations in both isolated and integrated scenarios.
5. **Reporting**: Generating detailed reports with insights and cURL commands for easy issue reproduction.

### Research Findings on Open-Source API Testing Tools

Our study, presented at the **44th International Conference on Software Engineering**, highlighted Schemathesis's performance:

- **Defect Detection**: identified a total of **755 bugs** in **16 services**, finding between **1.4× to 4.5× more defects** than the second-best tool in each case.

- **High Reliability**: consistently operates seamlessly on any project, ensuring unwavering stability and reliability.

## Testimonials

"_The world needs modern, spec-based API tests, so we can deliver APIs as-designed. Schemathesis is the right tool for that job._"

<div>Emmanuel Paraskakis - <strong>Level 250</strong></div>

---

"_Schemathesis is the only sane way to thoroughly test an API._"

<div>Zdenek Nemec - <strong>superface.ai</strong></div>

---

"_The tool is absolutely amazing as it can do the negative scenario testing instead of me and much faster! Before I was doing the same tests in Postman client. But it's much slower and brings maintenance burden._"

<div>Luděk Nový - <strong>JetBrains</strong></div>

---

"_Schemathesis is the best tool for fuzz testing of REST API on the market. We are at Red Hat use it for examining our applications in functional and integrations testing levels._"

<div>Dmitry Misharov - <strong>RedHat</strong></div>
