## Initialization

To set up ScriptMan for your project, you should call the following method from the `Settings` class upon start:

```python
from scriptman import Settings

Settings.init(
    app_dir='your_project_directory',
    logging=True,  # Enable logging (default is True)
    debugging=False,  # Enable debugging mode (default is False)
)
```

Calling this method will set up ScriptMan's app files in your project directory under the app folder. It will create various folders:

- `downloads`: Used for downloads (e.g., Downloads made by Selenium).
- `helpers`: Used for any extra modules you want to reuse in your code (e.g., API Classes).
- `scripts`: Where your scripts should reside.
- `Logs`: Where the log files will be saved.
