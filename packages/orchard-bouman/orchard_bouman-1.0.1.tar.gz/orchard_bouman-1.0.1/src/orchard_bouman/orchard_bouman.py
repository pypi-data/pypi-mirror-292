class Cluster:
    """
    Class Cluster finds initial clusters and splits child nodes based on orchard bouman clustering given an image and
    optional tuple of 3x3 R matrix, 1x3 M matrix, and points array of shape image, where 0 values represent pixels belonging
     to that cluster.
     To perform the initial node split, Cluster only requires the image and creates the initial R, M and points array before splitting the
    initial node into two nodes. Specifically, the split_cluster function returns R, M, and points array for each child
    node. Create_new_cluster uses the above function to create and return two new Cluster objects, each representing one of
    the child nodes.

    Note: It is unlikely that this class will be accessed directly. For the purposes of performing clustering on an image
    Cluster is accessed by the OrchardBouman class.

    Inputs:
    Image: 3-dimensional numpy array of RGB image
    RMp: If None, initializes RMp from image. Else, RMp should be a tuple of 3x3 R matrix, 1x3 M matrix, and points array
        NOTE: RMp is called internally in method create_new_cluster. RMp should not be supplied for an initial node split.

    Attributes:
    img: Original 3-dimensional numpy array of RGB image
    RMp: tuple of 3x3 R matrix, 1x3 M matrix, and points array for Cluster object
    channels: list of 2-dimensional numpy arrays, with each element representing the R, G, and B color channel
    R: 3x3 matrix representing the sum of squares of pixel values belonging to that node in each RGB color channel
    M: 1x3 matrix representing the sum of pixel values belonging to that node in each RGB color channel
    point_arr: 2-dimensional numpy zeros array of size image. Zeros represent pixel locations assigned to given node, else
        the value is np.nan
    N: total number of pixels in node
    Q: 1x3 matrix representing the average pixel value for each RGB color channel. Q = M / N
    lmbda: maximum eigenvalue
    e: principle eigenvector
