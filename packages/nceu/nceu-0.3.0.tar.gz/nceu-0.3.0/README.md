# NCeu (NCurses Email Usage)

NCeu is a command-line interface tool for managing and analyzing your Gmail inbox, inspired by the ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) utility. It provides an interactive, text-based user interface for exploring your emails, grouping them by sender, and performing actions like archiving.

## Features

- Authenticate with Gmail using OAuth2
- Download and analyze emails from your inbox
- Group emails by sender
- Sort emails by count or date
- View email details
- Archive individual emails or all emails from a sender directly from the interface
- Progress bar for archiving multiple emails
- ncurses-based UI for smooth navigation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

You can install NCeu using pip:

```
pip install nceu
```

This will install NCeu as a system-wide application.

If you want to install it from source:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ad3002/nceu.git
   cd nceu
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```
   pip install .
   ```

3. Set up Google Cloud Project and enable Gmail API:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable the Gmail API for your project
   - Create credentials (OAuth client ID) for a desktop application
   - Download the client configuration and save it as `credentials.json` in your working directory

## Setting Up a Test User

For security reasons, it's recommended to set up a test Gmail account instead of using your primary account during development and testing:

1. Create a new Gmail account for testing purposes.
2. In your Google Cloud Console project:
   - Go to the OAuth consent screen settings
   - Add your test Gmail address to the "Test users" section
3. Use this test account when authorizing the application during development and testing.

This approach allows you to safely test all features without risking your primary email account.

## Usage

After installation, you can run NCeu from anywhere in your system by simply typing:

```
nceu
```

On first run, you'll be prompted to authorize the application. Follow the provided URL to grant necessary permissions. Use your test account credentials for this step.

### Navigation
