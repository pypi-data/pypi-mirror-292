# PyConGrad
A somewhat optimized generic batch conjugate gradient algorithm that works with PyTorch, NumPy, CuPy, and whatever other backend you like as long as you code it up.

Heavily inspired by [sbarratt/torch_cg](https://github.com/sbarratt/torch_cg) and uses similar function signatures.

For more information, documentation, and detailed instructions, see the `examples` folder.  In particular, notebook 2 in that folder discusses how to exactly duplicate the behavior of the original torch_cg.
