## What is LLM Guard?

![LLM-Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard/blob/main/docs/assets/flow.png?raw=true)

By offering sanitization, detection of harmful language, prevention of data leakage, and resistance against prompt
injection attacks, LLM-Guard ensures that your interactions with LLMs remain safe and secure.

## Installation

Begin your journey with LLM Guard by downloading the package:

```sh
pip install llm-guard
```

## Getting Started

**Important Notes**:

- LLM Guard is designed for easy integration and deployment in production environments. While it's ready to use
  out-of-the-box, please be informed that we're constantly improving and updating the repository.
- Base functionality requires a limited number of libraries. As you explore more advanced features, necessary libraries
  will be automatically installed.
- Ensure you're using Python version 3.9 or higher. Confirm with: `python --version`.
- Library installation issues? Consider upgrading pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
