## Typing stubs for docker

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`docker`](https://github.com/docker/docker-py) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`docker`.

This version of `types-docker` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `docker==7.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/docker. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`257691b5c5b1145031a89e9e007f969796325db3`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/257691b5c5b1145031a89e9e007f969796325db3) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.377, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
