Here's a simple and effective `README.md` for your `winuvloop` package:

# winuvloop

`winuvloop` is a Python package that simplifies the installation of the appropriate event loop for your platform. It automatically installs `uvloop` on Linux/POSIX systems and `winloop` on Windows, allowing for seamless cross-platform development.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Automatically installs `uvloop` on POSIX systems and `winloop` on Windows.
- **Easy Integration**: Just add `winuvloop` to your `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` and let it handle the rest.
- **Simplified Event Loop Setup**: No need to worry about platform-specific event loop installation and initialization.

## Installation

You can install `winuvloop` via pip:

```bash
pip install winuvloop
```

Or by adding it to your `pyproject.toml` in a Poetry-managed project:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
winuvloop = "^0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Simply import the package, and use it as you would uv/win loop:

```python
import winuvloop

# the preferred way to use win/uv loop is with the run method
uvwinloop.run(my_coroutine)
```

alternatively, you can install the loop globally:
```python
import winuvloop

# The correct event loop is now installed and ready to use.
winuvloop.install()
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- `uvloop` for POSIX systems
- `winloop` for Windows systems

## Platform Support

- **POSIX (Linux, macOS)**: Installs `uvloop`
- **Windows**: Installs `winloop`
