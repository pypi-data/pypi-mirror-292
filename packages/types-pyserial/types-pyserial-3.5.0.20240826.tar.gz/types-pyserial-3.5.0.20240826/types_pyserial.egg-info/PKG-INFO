## Typing stubs for pyserial

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pyserial`](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pyserial`.

This version of `types-pyserial` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pyserial==3.5.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyserial. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`7c1378cc25b2f9dfb4efab68f4b4dbf1df1753bf`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/7c1378cc25b2f9dfb4efab68f4b4dbf1df1753bf) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.377, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
