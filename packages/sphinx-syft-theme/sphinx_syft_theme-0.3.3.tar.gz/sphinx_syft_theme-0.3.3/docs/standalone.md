# Standalone Pages

_Standalone_ pages are pages that don't have the Syft Sphinx Theme's `topbar`
nor any sidebar navigation. They are rendered like sections in the _Banner_-style
layout. Like the _Banner_ layout, titles in the _Standalone_ layout are all
created with `div` elements containing a Bootstrap `display` class.

## Sections

Sections in the _Standalone_ layout have nice spacing and decorations to make theme
stand out, without conforming to the _Banner_ style layout. Background colors are
not changed and spacing is meant to imply that the section content is intended to be
read as a single page.

### Subsections

And subsections are displayed like this!
