Setting up AutoCAS
==================

AutoCAS itself does not provide any utilities to perform quantum chemical calculations. It relies on
interfaces to quantum chemistry packages. Currently only the `OpenMolcas` electronic sturcture program
package  in combination with `QCMaquis` is supported. However, it is easy to set up a new interface
(see section New Interfaces).
