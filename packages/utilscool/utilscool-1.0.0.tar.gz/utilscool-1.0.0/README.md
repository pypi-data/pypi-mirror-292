# pretty print
This replaces the print function when imported.
The new syntax is:
`print("Hello",end = " ",color=RED, move_cursor = START_OF_LINE)`

# plot
Just throw some values into it and it will plot them :)
`plot([1,2,4,8])`

# Database

First initialize a new database

`columns = [("name",str),("id",int),("score", float)]`

`data = Database("filename.db", columns)`

Now data can be used as a list of dictionaries :)

`data.append(("NAME1", 1, 1.1))`

`data[0]["id"] #-> 1`

# Retry

Decorator for use in debugging or web-requests
```
@retry(retries = 3, delay = 1, exponential_delay = True)
def myfunc():
    pass
```

# Timer

`start_timer()` - Stars/resets timer

`get_timer()` - Gets timer value as a `datetime` object
