# python_opencv_toasty_animation

## Requirements

opencv-contrib-python 4.10.0.82
playsound 1.3.0

## Usage

Add these lines before the main loop to instantiate animation

    animation = Animation(image_path='toasty.png', sound_path='toasty.mp3')

Then before the `cv2.imshow('Video', frame)` execution add these

    animation.update_animation_state()
    frame = animation.apply_animation(frame)

The animation now is ready to be played, now you need to choice an event to fire the start.
Anywhere in the main loop add this line

    animation.start()

Optionally you can pass the `prevent_repetition=True` argument if the animation play too many times in the loop to control the repetition. By default it doesn't play until 300 seconds passed. You can change it passing `repetition_delay=300` in the arguments during the instantiation of the animation.
