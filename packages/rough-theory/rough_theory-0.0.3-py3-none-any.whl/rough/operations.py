        Partial dependency of knowledge: the derivation (dependency)

        In essence, knowledge Q depends on a degree k (0 <= k <= 1) from
        knowledge P, symbolically P ==>_{k} Q.

        If k = 1, then Q totally depends on P; if 0 < k < 1, then Q roughly
        (partially) depends on P, and if k = 0, then Q is totally independent
        from knowledge P.

        can be classified to elementary categories of U / Q. If k != 1, only
        those elements of the universe which belong to the positive region
        can be classified to categories of knowledge Q, employing knowledge P.
        In particular, if k = 0, then none of the elements of the universe can
        be classified using knowledge P to elementary categories of knowledge Q.

        Disclaimer: The measure k of dependency, $P -->_{k} Q$, does not capture
        how this partial dependency is actually distributed among classes of
        U / Q. For example, some decision classes can be fully characterized by P,
        whereas others may be characterized only partially. Hence, an alternative
        definition is proposed where $gamma(X) = card(P_lower X) / card(X)$ where
        $X in U / Q$ which shows how many elements of each class of U / Q can be
        classified by employing knowledge P.

        To use the 'alternative definition', change the 'category' argument to a set
        that occurs in U / Q. When using the alternative definition, 'Q' can
