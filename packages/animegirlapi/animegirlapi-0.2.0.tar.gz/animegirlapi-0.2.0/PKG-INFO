# Random Image Fetcher

This Python module provides a function to fetch random images from an API based on specified tags and ratings. It supports filtering images by tags and ratings and allows for customization of the number of images requested.

## Function: `get_random_image`

### Description
Fetches a random image from the API that matches the specified tag(s) and/or rating(s).

### Parameters
- `number` (int): The number of images to request. Default is `1`. Must be 100 or fewer.
- `tag` (Union[str, tuple, list], optional): A tag or a list of tags to filter images. If `None`, no tag filtering is applied.
- `rating` (Union[str, tuple, list], optional): A rating or a list of ratings to filter images. If `None`, no rating filtering is applied.
- `ignore` (bool, optional): If `False` and not enough images are found, a warning is printed. If `True`, no warning is printed. Default is `False`.

### Returns
- A list of URLs for the requested number of images. Returns an empty list if no images are found.

### Example Usage
```python
from your_module import get_random_image
```

# Fetch 5 random images with tag "yuri" and rating "safe"
print(get_random_image(number=5, tag="yuri", rating="safe"))

# Fetch 10 random images with tag "cute" without checking for rating
print(get_random_image(number=10, tag="cute"))

# Fetch 3 random images with rating "explicit" and ignore the warning if not enough images are found
print(get_random_image(number=3, rating="explicit", ignore=True))

# Error Handling
Raises a ValueError if number exceeds 100.
Prints a warning message if the number of images requested cannot be fulfilled and ignore is False.
