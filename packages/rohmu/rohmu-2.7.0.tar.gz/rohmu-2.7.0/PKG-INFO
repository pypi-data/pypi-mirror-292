Rohmu is a Python library for building backup tools for databases providing functionality for
compression, encryption, and transferring data between the database and an object storage. Rohmu
supports main public clouds such as GCP, AWS, and Azure for backup storage. Rohmu is used in various
backup tools such as PGHoard_ for PostgreSQL, MyHoard_ for MySQL, and Astacus_ for M3, ClickHouse,
and other databases.
