#  torch_linear_regression 
A very simple library containing closed-form linear regression models using PyTorch.
Includes:
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression: `(X'X)^-1 X'Y`
- Ridge Regression: `(X'X + Î»I)^-1 X'Y`
- Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) with Ridge penalty: Ridge regression followed by SVD on the weights matrix

The closed-form approach results in fast and accurate results under most
conditions. However, when ``n_features`` is large and/or underdetermined
(``n_samples`` <= ``n_features``), the solution will start to diverge from
gradient-based / sklearn solutions.

Each model also includes a `model.prefit()` method that can be used to precompute
the inverse matrix and the ridge penalty matrix. This can be useful when the model
is used multiple times with the same `X` input data.

Because the models are based on PyTorch, they are significantly faster than sklearn's
models, and can be further accelerated by using GPU. Also the models can be used
in conjunction with PyTorch's autograd for gradient-based optimization.

## Installation
Install stable version:
```
pip install torch_linear_regression
```

Install development version:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/RichieHakim/torch_linear_regression.git
```

## Usage 
See the notebook for more examples: [demo notebook](https://github.com/RichieHakim/torch_linear_regression/blob/master/demo_notebook.ipynb)
```
import torch_linear_regression as tlr

import torch
import numpy as np
import sklearn
import sklearn.datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


## Generate data for regression
X, Y = sklearn.datasets.make_regression(
    n_samples=100,
    n_features=2,
    n_informative=10,
    bias=2,
    noise=50,
    random_state=42,
)

## Create model
model_ols = tlr.OLS()
## Fit model
model_ols.fit(X=X, y=Y)
## Predict
Y_pred = model_ols.predict(X)
## Score model
score = model_ols.score(X=X, y=Y)
print(f"R^2: {score}")
```
