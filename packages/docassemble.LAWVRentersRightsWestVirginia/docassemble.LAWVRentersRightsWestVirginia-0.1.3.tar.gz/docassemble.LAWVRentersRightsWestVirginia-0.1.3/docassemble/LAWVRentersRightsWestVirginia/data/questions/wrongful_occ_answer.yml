  It appears you need to file an appeal
subquestion: |  
  Because you have already had a final hearing and received a Civil Judgment Order or an Order of Possession, your case with the Magistrate Court is complete.  

  If you do not agree with the Magistrate Court decision, you can [file an appeal](https://legalaidwv.org/legal-information/appealing-an-eviction-case-to-circuit-court/) asking a Circuit Court to review it. There are deadlines for filing an appeal. You must act quickly and you may also want to try to get legal help.
