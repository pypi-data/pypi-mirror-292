# History

Historically, in 2023, the project was initiated under the name ``PySeams``,
which could not be registered on PyPI due to naming similarities, so the project
in 2024 switched to its current name, ``PydSEAMSlib``.

## Funding

Apart from contributing many hours of unpaid labor from volunteers, the d-SEAMS
project has been granted funding from GSoC over the years to support the Python
bindings effort.

### 2023

This project was conceived as part of d-SEAMâ€™s participation under the Python
Software Foundation (PSF) in the [2023 iteration of the Google Summer of Code
programme](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/WAft7HXq).
