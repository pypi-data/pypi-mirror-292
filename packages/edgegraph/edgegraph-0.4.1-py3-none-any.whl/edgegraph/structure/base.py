    """
    Top of the object inheritance tree for everything.

    That's not quite a joke -- this class is the top of the tree when it comes
    to object types.  All other objects in edgegraph inherit from this one.

    It provides a few standardized attributes and access methods:

    * Universal unique identifier
    * Dynamic attributes storage
    * Universe association

    Through the "dynamic attributes storage", this object works as a namespace
    -- it is intended for adding attributes after initialization /
    instantiation.  For example:

       >>> b = BaseObject()
       >>> dir(b)
       []
       >>> b.x = 17
       >>> b.x
       17
       >>> dir(b)
       ['x']

    The attributes provided to the ``__init__`` method also become a part of
    this operation:

       >>> b = BaseObject(attributes={"fifteen": 15})
       >>> dir(b)
       ['fifteen']
       >>> b.fifteen
       15
