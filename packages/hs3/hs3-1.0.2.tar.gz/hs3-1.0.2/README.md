# HS$^3$ Utilities

Python HS$^3$ Utilities (`hs3`) is a collection of command-line tools and
utilities designed to support the High-Energy Physics Statistics
Serialization Standard (HS$^3$). This package provides tools for working
with HS$^3$ JSON files, including functionality for generating GraphML
representations and diffing HS$^3$ files.

## Features

- **`hs3diff`**: A tool to compare two HS$^3$ JSON files and generate a diff.
- **`hs3tographml`**: A tool to convert HS$^3$ JSON files into GraphML format for visualization.

## Installation

You can install HS$^3$ Utilities from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install hs3
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install the package locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hep-statistics-serialization-standard/python-hep-statistics-serialization-standard
cd python-hep-statistics-serialization-standard
pip install .
```

## Usage

### hs3diff

`hs3diff` is used to compare two HS$^3$ JSON files and output the differences.

### Usage Example:

```bash
hs3diff file1.json file2.json
```

This command will output the differences between `file1.json` and `file2.json`.

### hs3tographml

`hs3tographml` converts an HS$^3$ JSON file into a GraphML file, which can be visualized using tools like Gephi.

### Usage Example:

```bash
hs3tographml -i model.json -o model.graphml
```

This command will convert `model.json` into `model.graphml`.

### Options
- `-i`, `--input`: Input JSON file (required).
- `-o`, `--output`: Output GraphML file (required).
- `-l`, `--likelihood`: Name of the likelihood to use (optional).
