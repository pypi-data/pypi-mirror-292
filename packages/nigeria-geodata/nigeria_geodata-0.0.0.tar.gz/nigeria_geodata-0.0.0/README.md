Nigeria Geodata is a fast and efficient Python client for accessing geospatial data for Nigeria.

The key features are:

- **High Performance**: Offers exceptional speed with both synchronous and asynchronous support to cater to different use cases and performance needs
- **Map Visualization**: Provides smooth map visualization using the fast [lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) library.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependenciesâ€”just one required ([httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/)), with optional extras available for additional features.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use and learn; set up quickly with just a few lines of code.
- **CLI Support**: Intuitive command-line interface built with Typer.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches up-to-date data directly from the [GRID3](https://grid3.org/) database (more to come!), ensuring you always work with the latest information.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Allows for precise filtering based on state names (e.g FCT, Lagos), bounding boxes (bbox), and areas of interest (AOI).

## Dependency

nigeria_geodata depends on only one core package:

- [Httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) - for the api requests.

## Additional Optional Dependencies

There are some additional dependencies you might want to install.

- [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) - for cli support.
- [Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) - for map visualization.
- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) - to return the data as a geodataframe.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - to return the data as a dataframe.

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment and then install nigeria_geodata:

To install the lightweight version using pip:

<!-- termynal -->

```py
pip install nigeria-geodata
---> 100%
```

This version will return all the data as Python objects, mostly as a list, and list of dicts.

To install it with `typer`, `lonboard` and `geopandas`:

<!-- termynal -->

```py
pip install nigeria-geodata['standard']
---> 100%
```

This version will allow you to get the data as a dataframe, geodataframe, or an interactive map.

<!-- termynal -->

```py
pip install nigeria-geodata['cli']
---> 100%
```

This version provides CLI support for the package. It is also lightweight -- It will return the data as pure Python objects.

## Get Started

For the simplest usecase, search for all the available health care data in Nigeria.

<!-- termynal -->

```py
from nigeria_geodata import Grid3, AsyncGrid3
# Sync
search_results = Grid3().search("health")
print(search_results)
# this will return a dataframe with all the available health care datasets.

# Async
search_results = await AsyncGrid3().search("health")
print(search_results)
# this will return a dataframe with all the available health care datasets.
```

Under the hood, this makes an api request to the GRID3 database to get the datasets. Refer to the **documentation** and **examples** for more use cases.

## Acknowledgment

In addition to the great libraries we're resting upon, we would also like to thank [GRID3](https://grid3.org/) for providing real-time and comprehensive geospatial data that powers this library.
